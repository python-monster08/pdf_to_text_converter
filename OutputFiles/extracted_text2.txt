wisdom, the mind becomes free, radiant, and joyful and he
who has realized the Truth (Nirvana) is the happiest being
in the world. He is free from all complexes and obsessions.

changes, earthquakes might have brought the civilization
to its end therefore people employing horse drawn chariots
in warfare is not true. Moreover, Indus valley seals show

but it is also conceived as an extremely subtle matter which
infiltrates the soul, obscuring its natural, transparent, pure
qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution that taints
the soul with various colors. Based on its karma, a soul

bodhisattva is also normally thought of as consciously
working towards enlightenment: you can’t call someone a
bodhisattva just because they might be enlightened in the
future if they haven’t started making an effort yet. For this
reason, the earliest use of the term ‘bodhisattva’ refers to
Siddhartha Gautama before he gained enlightenment, and

laid a strong foundation in the British Indian administrative
system in the year 
1793. The judicial reforms of Cornwallis
were documented in the famous Cornwallis Code. However
the new judicial reforms of Lord Cornwallis were based on
the principle of Separation of Powers. Cornwallis at first
sought to separate the revenue administration from the
administration of justice. The collector used to be the head
of the Revenue Department in a district and also enjoyed
extensive judicial and magisterial powers. However
Cornwallis wanted Separation of Power and the Cornwallis
Code divested the collector of all the judicial and the
magisterial powers. Thus the Collectors were given only
the power of the revenue administration according to the
Cornwallis Code. A new class of officer called the District
Judge was created to preside over the district Civil Court.

76. (d) That the reforms of Cornwallis had increased the litigation
and the main reason for this was the Court Fee was removed
and now every body could drag anybody to courts. The
extension to right of appeal was also one of the reasons.
Court fees were abolished by Cornwallis. Lawyers were to
prescribe their fees. Ordinary people could sue the
Government servants (Indians) if they committed mistakes.
Inhuman punishments such as cutting limbs, cutting nose
and ears were abolished. These are some of the reasons that
led to increased litigation. The reasons given in the options
don’t seem to fit in the criteria of the reforms of Cornwallis.

77. (d) The first option is rejected because it used the term
“tribal products”. The second option is rejected because
NOT in all areas, the impact of foreign missionaries was
seen. The third option is also NOT correct, because not in
all areas saw the rise of money lenders. The fourth option is
correct and it includes everything what happened in that
era. The most common thing was the foreign interference in
the indigenous world of their own which dismantled the
structure that existed since centuries.

78. (d) It is clear from Economic History of India by RC Datt:
“ The Indian Tribute whether weighted in the scales of justice
or viewed in the light of our interest, will be found to be at
variance with humanity, with the commonsense and with
the received maxims of economical science. It would be true
wisdom then to provide for the future payment of such ofthe Home Charges of the Indian Government as really from
the tribute out of Indian Exchequer. These charges would
be probably found to be the dividends on East India Stock,
interest in Home debt, the salaries of the officers,
establishments of the and building connected with the Home
Department of Indian Government, furlough and retired pay
to members of the Indian Military and Civil Services when
at Home, Charges of all descriptions paid in this country
connected with the British troops serving in India and
portion of the cost of transporting the British troops to and
from India”.

larger forces of Ibrahim Lodhi. Tobacco was introduced in
India by Portuguese in 16th or 17th century.

83. (c) Ilbert bill exempted British subjects from trial by Indian
magistrates and in cases involving death or transportation
the y c o u ld o nly b e trie d b y a hig h c o u rt. This p ro p o s al

as the announcement reversed Lord Dalhousie's pre-war
policy of political unification through princely state
annexation.It was also to place the Indian administration
under the British Crown Therefore, statement 1 & 2 are
correct. However it was not to regulate East India Company's
trade with India so statement 3 is wrong.

87. (b) Manganiyars–a tribal community from Rajasthan (North
west) with a strong musical tradition.

88. (a) The Ghadar Party was a revolutionary association
founded by Punjabi Indians, in the United States and Canada

rule. Key members included Lala Har Dayal, Sohan Singh
Bhakna, Kartar Singh Sarabha, and Rashbehari Bose.It had
its headquarters at San Francisco.

89. (b) A person became a vassal by pledging political allegiance
and providing military, political, and financial service to a
lord. A lord possessed complete sovereignty over land or


Modern History A37
acted in the service of another sovereign, usually a king. If a
lord acted in the service of a king, the lord was considered a
vassal of the king. As part of the feudal agreement, the lord
promised to protect the vassal and provided the vassal with
a plot of land. This land could be passed on to the vassal's
heirs, giving the vassal tenure over the land.

90. (d) Dadabhai Naoroji, R. C. Dutt, Ranade, Gokhale, G .
Subramania Iyer, were among those who grounded Indian
nationalism firmly on the foundation of anti-imperialism by
fashioning the world's first economic critique of colonialism,
before Hobson and Lenin.

93. (d) (i) The Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms were reforms
introduced by the British Government in India to introduce self-
governing institutions gradually to India. The reforms were
outlined in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report prepared in 1918
and formed the basis of the Government of India Act 
1919.

94. (b) In 1881, Keshab Chandra Sen established NabaBidhan
(New Dispensation) meaning new universalist religion after
having differences within BrahmoSamaj. He was also part of
Indian reform association to legalize Brahmo marriage and to
fix minimum age of marriage. Calcutta Unitarian Committee

William Adam, hence irrelevant to the question. Hence
Answer (b) only 2 and 
3.

95. (b) (i) Extremists and moderates both seemed to be
locking horns. The Extremists thought that the people had
been encouraged and the battle for freedom had begun.
They felt the time had come for the big push to drive the
British out and considered the Moderates to be a stumbling
block to the movement.
(ii) So, Surat split occurred because extremists were
dissatisfied with Moderates’ capacity to negotiate with the
British.

Annamacharya and Tyagaraja (born in 1767) can't be be
contemporaries. By elimination we get B: 2 and 4 only .

98. (d)
•NEW NCERT, Std 8- Our Past III, Chapter 2: "….The
fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big

companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these
goods could be purchase(d)"
•NEW NCERT St(d)12- Ch.12 Colonial Cities: "….By
the end of the nineteenth century, half the imports and
exports of India passed through Bombay. One importantitem of this trade was opium that the East India Company
exported to Chin(a)"
•"Indigo and saltpetre were the other major imports from
India, and the fact that both products were produced in the
eastern Gangetic plain, especially in Bihar, stimulated British
efforts to establish factories on the east coast as well as the
west coast of the Indian subcontinent." So Saltpetre was
indeed exported otherwise British wouldn't have made
efforts to setup factories on East coast.

2. Fort William College was established by Lord Wellesley
(1798) for the training of civil servants. But, Arthur Wellesley
was the brother of Lord Wellesley who fought the 4th Anglo-
Mysore war against Tipu Sultan. Arthur Wellesley, forced
Tipu to retreat to his capital Srirangapattinam. (Tamilnadu

3. Thus by elimination, we are left with B: only 
2.

103. (a) Wood's dispatch recommended that Primary and
secondary education should be in V ernacular language.*"

108. (b) Bipan Chandra's India Since Independence, Ch.31 on
Land Reforms (III)
• In most states, initially , the ceilings were imposed on
individual and not family holdings, enabling landowners to
divide up their holdings 'notionally' in the names of
relatives merely to avoid the ceiling. So, (a) is wrong.
• A large number of exemptions to the ceiling limits were
permitted by most states following the Second Plan
recommendations that certain categories of land could be
exempted from ceilings. These were tea, coffee and rubber
plantations, orchards, specialized farms etc. So, (d) is
wrong.
• C is a 'hyperbole' wrong statement. Land reform is not
responsible for cash crop cultivation becoming predominant
in India. Besides, majority of India's area under cultivation is
foodgrains and cereals. (and not cash crops) as per Table3,

• Thus, (b) is the most suitable answer.

109. (a)
• The Company's monopoly over trade in India ended,
but the Company retained the trade with China and the
trade in tea. So #1 is right.
• T h e C o m p a n y w a s t o r e t a i n t h e p o s s e s s i o n o f

the 1920s in South India, the non-brahmins organised the
Self-Respect Movement led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker.
• So, (d): all three are correct.
111. (a)
• 20th (twentieth) century means 1/1/1901 to 31/12/

2000. We have to find out why Indigo cultivation
declined by the beginning of 
1901.
• 1917: Gandhi-ji’s Champaran Satyagraha. So, (c) is
not fitting the timeline.
• NCERT Our Past-III: Page 35-36: In March 1859
thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As
the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the
planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with
swords and spears, bows and arrows......After the revolt,
indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters
now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery
of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their
business was severely affected, but yet they managed to
expand production. In other words, the invention of
artificial dye did not affect them yet.

112. (d)
• Lord Wellesley (1798-1805) wanted adequate
training for the European civil servants. At Fort William
College in Calcutta the civil servants from all the
presidencies took three years of training before getting
their civil posting.
• But the Court of Directors feared that such a
training programme might result in the loyalties of the
civil servants shifting from London to Calcutta. So in
1802 Fort William College was closed.

113. (a)
• Machines were very few. They were introduced in
the starting of the 20th Century CE ’! (b) is wrong.
• Railway lines were laid post 1850s- i.e. second half
of the 19th Century CE ’! (c) is wrong.
• The British goods were given duty free trade
permits ’! (d) is wrong.
• Since Option (b), (c) & (d)-Incorrect, Therefore we
are left with the answer “(a)”.

114. (a)
• Can be answered from elimination because BR
Ambedkar & MK Gandhi worked in the 20th Century. And
Jyotiba Phule wrote- Ghulam Giri (Book)
• Hence only (a) option is left, which is correct.

to be administered. The government announced partition
in July 
1905. To boycott this, on Aug 7, 1905, formal
proclamation of Swadeshi movement was made from the
Calcutta townhall.

142. (b) Statement 1 is incorrect as it was Raj Kumar Shukla
who requested Gandhi to come to Champaran to investigate
the problems of peasants. Gandhi’s colleagues in this
movement were JB Kriplani, Rajendra Prasad, Mazhar-ul-

passed at the Bombay session of the All India Congress
Committee and here Gandhi made a call to participate people

had opposed this movement and it virtually damaged the
labour movement. Labour Unions under Communist
influence had apparently decided against participation in
the movement, there were large-scale strikes in mills at
Kanpur, Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad. There was an
indifference of the Labour Class, so the statement d is
correct. The First statement in this question needs to be
looked into. The Quit India Movement was basically
promoted a nonviolent and noncooperative movement but
it was not a non-violent. There were various events in which
Police station, Railway Stations, Railway Lines and Post-
Offices were burnt and destroyed.

147. (a) However, a famine had struck the district and a large
part of Gujarat, and virtually destroyed the agrarian economy .
The poor peasants had barely enough to feed themselves,
but the British government of the Bombay Presidency
insisted that the farmers not only pay full taxes, but also
pay the 23% increase stated to take effect that year.

148. (b) The statement a is incorrect because from Ruskin’s
writing Gandhi derived the message that “the job of a lawyer
is equal to a job of a barber, and both have right to earn their
livelihood”. Statement b is correct because Gandhi clearly
mentioned in one of his writing that The good of individual
is contained in the good of all, this is something which
inspired him to translate the book into “Sarvodaya”.
Statement c is incorrect, what Gandhi derived from this book
was of a “life of labour” and not life of celibacy. Celibacy or
Brahamcharya was something which actually came out of
his own guilt beginning as early as the days of death of his
father”.
149. (a) Usha Mehta (March 25, 1920 – August 11, 2000) was a

League. She also became the President of Indian National
Congress in 
1917. But she was not the founder of the
Theosophical Society; rather she was the second President
of the society. The founder was Henry Steel Olcott.

161. (c) In November 1927, the British govt. appointed the
Indian statutory commission, known popularly after the
name of its chairman as the Simon Commission. All the
members of the commission were Englishmen. This
announcement was greeted with chorus of protest from all
Indians. What angered them most was the exclusion of
Indians from the commission and the basic notion behind
this exclusion was that foreigners would discuss and decide
upon India’s fitness for Self- government.

162. (b) The British Govt. sent a delegation to India under Sir
Stafford Cripps, to negotiate with the Indian National
Congress a deal to obtain total cooperation during the war,
in return of progressive devolution and distribution of power
from the Crown and the Viceroy to an elected Indian
Legislature. The talks failed, as they did not address the
key demand of a time table of self government and of
definition of the powers to be relinquished, essentially
making an offer of limited dominion status that was wholly
unacceptable to the Indian movement.


A57Indian National Movement A57

163. (b) The 1929 Session of Indian, National Congress is of
significance in the history of the Freedom Movement
because the attainment of Poorna Swaraj was adopted as
the goal of the Congress.

164. (a) Surat split is an important event in the modern history
of India. It took place in 1907 when the moderates parted
company with the Extremists. The split in the congress was
due to many reasons. The Moderates had controlled the
congress from its very beginning and had their own ways
of thinking and doing which were not acceptable to the
younger generations who were impatient with the speed at
which the moderates were moving and leading the nation.
This was the time of Swadeshi Movement.

165. (d) All statements are wrong.

166. (b) The Rowlatt committee was a Sedition Committee

networks-The Home Rule Leagues, Certain pan islamist
groups and a satyagraha sabha which he himself started in
Bombay on 24 February.

167. (b) C. Rajagopalachari organized a march from
Trichinopoly to V edaranniyam on the Tanjore coast to break
the salt law in April 
1930.

168. (b) Annie Besant was the first woman President of Indian
National Congress. She presided over the 1917 Calcutta
session of the Indian National Congress. Badruddin Tyabji

Bengal had been made public in December 
1903.

products and using only Indian-made goods.
(iii) Swadeshi and Boycott started against Partition of
Bengal in

174. (d) The Butler Committee (1927) was set up to examine
the nature of relationship between the states and
Government. Hence "D" is the fitting answer.

175. (d) The Trade disputes Act of April 1929 imposed a
system of tribunals and tried to ban strikes 'undertaken
for objects other than furtherance of a trade dispute or if
designed to coerce Government and/or inflict hardships
on the community.' Hence "D" is the answer.

176. (b) Lord Ripon introduced the Factory Act of 1881 to
improve the service condition of the factory workers in
India. The Act banned the appointment of children below
the age of seven in factories. It reduced the working
hours for children. It made compulsory for all dangerous
machines in the factories to be properly fenced to ensure
security to the workers. So statement #1 is wrong.
•In Bombay, middle class philanthropic efforts to
improve labour conditions began fairly early with N.M.
Lokhende starting weekly Dinabandhu in 1880….and even
starting a Bombay Mill-hands Association in 
1890. So,
statement #2 is right. Hence "B" is the answer.

177. (c) Lala Lajpat Rai founded the Indian Home Rule League
in the US in 1916 (TN History Class 12 book, page 150).

glacier.

39. (c) Quartzite is a metamorphosed form of sandstone.

40. (a) The correct order of soil erosion process is splash
erosion, sheet erosion, rill erosion and gully erosion. Splash
occurs when the raindrop hits the surface; explosive impact
soil into individual particles. Sheet erosion is the detachment
of soil particles by rain drop and their removal down slope
by water flowing overland as a sheet in definite channels.
Rill erosion refers to the development of small ephemeral
concentrated flow paths which function as both sedimentary
source and sediment delivery systems for erosion on hill
slopes. Sheet erosion removes the this top layer by raindrop
kill or orion occurs in lines which are less than 30 cm deepwhen these rills are deeper than 30 forming channels are
called as gully erosion. Gully erosion occurs when water
flows in narrow channels after heavy rain and melting snow .

41. (a) The region will be Mediterranean according to the

Mediterranean climate is characterised by hot, dry summers
and warm, wet winters.

42. (c) The sun, the earth and the moon come in the position
of quadrature (form-a right angle) on seventh and eighth
day of every fortnight of a month and thus the tide producing
forces of the sun and the moon works in opposite direction,
causing low tide. This is lower in height than the normal tide
and is called neap tide. But the spring tide occurs during full
moon and are called high tides.

43. (c) Sun halo also known as 22 degree halo, the ring is
caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus
clouds with in the Earth's atmosphere.

44. (b) Ocean currents are not slow most of the time and can

Tropical ever green.

47. (c) A is true but R is false.
Sub-polar low pressure is located between 60–65º
latitude in both hemisphere. Low pressure is produced in
this area, because the surface air spreads outward from this
zone due to rotation of earth.

48. (a) Air begins to slowly descend in the centre of the storm,
creating a rain-free area. This is a newly formed eye. On
land, the centre of the eye is, by for, the calmest part of the
storm.

49. (d) The thunder clouds develop by the above climatic and
geographic phenomena. High temperature and humidity
causes the wind to rise vertically up and due to orography
and pressure of mountains these winds get condensed and
form cumulonimbus clouds or thunder clouds.

50. (c) E1 Nino and La Nina are opposite phases of what is
known as the E1 Nino-southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle.
The ENSO cycle is a scientific term that describes the
fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and

57. (b) Jupiter takes maximum time for one revolution i.e., 11
year 86 days. Mars take 687 days, V enus takes 267 days.

58. (d) The circulation of atmosphere and oceans is funda-
mentally caused by the fact that the amount of incoming
solar radiation varies from a maximum at the equator to a
minimum at the poles. More reflection and absorption of
incoming radiation takes place in high latitude because of
the greater thickness of atmosphere that must be penetrated.
Thickness of the earth is maximum over the pole.

59. (d) V olcanic mountain. St. Helen is located in United States
of America.

60. (c ) The moon rotates about its own axis in 
27.322 days.
When the Moon first formed, its rotational speed and orbit
were very different than they are now. Over time, the Earth's
gravitational field gradually slowed the Moon's rotation
until the orbital period and the rotational speed stabilized,
making one side of the moon always face the Earth.

61. (a) The atmosphere of Venus is composed primarily of
carbon dioxide and much denser and hotter than that of Earth.
The atmosphere of V enus supports opaque clouds made of
sulfuric acid, making optical Earth-based and orbital
observation of the surface impossible.

62. (a) A is true as the direction of wind in the northern
hemisphere is clock wise and in southern hemisphere it is
anti clock wise. The explanation is correct as this is mainly

71. (b) The maximum and minimum annual temperatures of
Ocean water are recorded in August and
February respectively in the northern hemisphere.
The annual range of temperature is higher in the enclosed
seas than in the open sea.
The Atlantic Ocean records relatively higher annual range
of temperature than the Pacific Ocean.
Since the Northern hemisphere has more landmass as
compared to the Southern hemisphere, the annual range of
temperature will be greater in northern hemisphere.

72. (a) Albedo is the fraction of the incident sunlight that is

The tropical rainforests receive annual precipitation amounts
of 60 to 160 inches. (152 to 406 cm). Some rainforests in the
world experiences annual rainfall amounts of almost 400
inches.

79. (b) Normal El Nino forms in south–eastern Pacific whereas
as El Nino Modoki forms in central Pacific and causes greater
number of hurricanes.

80. (c) The Albedo of Snow is highest.

81. (a) Mediterrian climate have mild, rainy winter and hot,
dry summers and Evergreen, Oak trees.

82. (c) Rotation of the earth causes wind to deflect towards
left in the Southern Hemisphere.

83. (a) The soils of tropical rainforest are relatively poor in
nutrients. Due to torrential rains most of the nutrients
washed out of the soil and the soils contain less organic
matter than the tropical deciduous forests. Nutrients in the
soil are often in forms that are not accessible by plants,
unlike tropical deciduous forests where major nutrients
remain in the soil. Thus if a tropical rain forest is removed it
does not regenerate quickly as compared to a tropical
deciduous forest.

84. (b) Statement 1 is wrong, ionosphere contains charged
particles due to which electromagnetic radio waves gets
reflected and communication becomes possible. Ozone is
found mainly in stratosphere and in traces in troposphere.
Its main function is absorption of UV rays. While the ions
give the ionosphere its name, it is the free electrons that
effect the radio waves and radio communications. Also Radio
waves have the longest wave length in the EM spectrum.

comets are mode up of small icy particles and Neteoric
fragments.
87. (a) The speed of these winds are higher and persistence
in southern hemisphere. The land mass in southern
hemisphere is lesser in comparison to northern hemisphere.
As these winds crosses the landmass its velocity decreases.
Thus the effect of westerlies is less over northern hemisphere
than in southern hemisphere.

1. Rotation of the Earth

2. Air pressure and wind

3. Density of ocean water. Revolution has no impact on
ocean currents.

92. (c) Atmosphere is heated by infrared radiation, Moisture
is more in lower atmosphere. In the upper atmosphere Air is
less dense which hold less heat thus temperature is low.

93. (d) Savannah covers approximately 20% of the Earth's land
area. The largest area of Savannah is in Africa. The tropical
Savannah region has a definite dry and wet season.
Savannah grasslands are much richer in humus than the
equatorial forests.

94. (b) Atlas mountain ranges are situated in the north western
part of Africa. They extend almost 2000 km. They pass
through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.

95. (d) V ariations in the length of daytime and nighttion from
season to season are due to the revolution of the earth on a
tilted axis.

96. (c) Out of all the water on Earth, Saline water in oceans,
seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only

2.5-
2.75% is fresh water, including 
1.75-2% frozen in
glaciers, ice and snow, 
0.5-
0.75% as fresh groundwater
and soil moisture and less than 
0.01% of it as surface water
in lakes, Swamps and rivers.

97. (d) From electromagnetic radiation to revolution of the
earth, everything is responsible for bringing dynamic
changes on the surface of the earth. For example:
Electromagnetic radiation brings changes in the field of
microwaves, wavelengths of radio, UV rays, infra red rays,
X ray s and gamma ray s. Geo thermal energy is the heat
received from the earth’s core. This heat continuously flows
outward. It transfers to the surrounding layers of rock, the
mantle. When temperature and pressure becomes very high
some mantle rocks melt becoming magma. It then either
comes out as lava or heat up the nearby rocks and water
which comes out as hot springs or geysers. Gravitational

force is constantly working on all physical bodies. It is giving
weights to objects with mass and causes them to fall to the
ground when dropped. Plate movement is a dynamic change
on the surface of the earth. It explains many aspects of the
interrelationship of volcanoes, earthquakes, climate change,
and the evolution of life itself. Everything about our planet
is related either directly or indirectly to plate tectonic.
Rotation causes day and night. Revolution causes seasons,
change in the length of day and night.

98. (c) The mixing of warm and cold current in the region where
planktons are found, is food for fishes. The temperature is
just right for them to survive.
The temperature is just right for the growth of fish food
called planktons.

99. (d) The canopy is the primary layer of the forest forming a
roof over the two remaining layers. The densest of the
biodiversity is found here along with a large variety of
epiphytes.

100. (a) The first statement is correct. One major factor affecting
the distribution of the temperature of Earth is distribution
of Land and Oceans. Since there is more land in
Northern Hemisphere and more waters in Southern
hemisphere and there is a big difference between the
specific heat of land and water; the loss of heat from the
continents is bigger than the oceans. The continents get
heated faster and get cooled faster in comparison to the
Oceans. This is the reason that the temperatures of the
Oceans are moderate while that of continents is extreme.
The moderating effect on temperature of the land due to
proximity of the seas is called Maritime influence. The
increasing effect on temperature of the land at interior of the
continents is called Continental Influence.

101. (b) The central Asian steppes run through Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia. The climate here
is harsh with dust storms, little to no rainfall and temperature
ranging from – 4 to 50 degree Celsius.

102. (c) Continental Drift has effected the evolution of animals,
the world's geographical positions and the world's climates.
The split of the original super land mass Pangea into
Gondwanaland and the laurasia created new geographical/
climatic regions.
The rearrangement and displacement of huge landmasses
has helped create the diversity which we see in modern day
species.
The final stages of evolution of Genus Homo occurs in the
last 3 glacial cycles.

103. (b) The Westerlies are prevailing winds from the west
toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60
degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas
in the horse latitudes and tend towards the poles and steer
extra tropical cyclones in this general manner. The moist air
masses that cause winter rains in North-Western region of
India are part of westerlies.

104. (d) Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the
combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the
Moon, Sun, and rotation of the Earth.

105. (b) The passage points out equatorial region.

106. (a) One of the main factors that is responsible for originof tropical cyclones include Large sea surface with
temperature higher than 27° C. But in the South Atlantic
and South-Eastern Pacific regions the sea surface
temperatures are not enough to form a tropical cyclone
formation due to its tendency to remain relatively cooler
and this dominates over other factors and prevent any
cyclone origination in the region.

107. (a) The Earth's rotation on its axis explains the eastward
flow of the equatorial counter-current. If the earth would
have been rotating east to west, the piled up water would
have come down on the west side. Therefore, essentially
it's the earth's rotation that explains the eastward flow of
equatorial counter current.

108. (d) The Brahmaputra enters India in the state of
Arunachal Pradesh from its original source Tibet, and is
joined by the Dibang River and the Lohit River at the head
of the Assam V alley . It is joined in Sonitpur by the Kameng
River (or Jia Bhoreli).
Brahmaputra’s main left bank tributaries, viz., Dibang or
Sikang and Lohit. The important right bank tributaries are
the Subansiri, Kameng, Manas and Sankosh.
Therefore, all 3 correct.

109. (b)
• The Hindu: Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is an event
which the western Indian Ocean becomes alternately
warmer and then colder than the eastern part of the Indian
ocean. So first statement is wrong.
• A positive IOD leads to greater monsoon rainfall and
more active (above normal rainfall) monsoon days while
negative IOD leads to less rainfall and more monsoon
b r e a k d a y s ( n o r a i n f a l l ) . S o y e s , I O D c a n i n f l u e n c e E l
Nino's impact on Monsoon. So second statement is right.

110. (a) Barren Island volcano became active again in March,

1991. A second phase of eruptions started in 
1995. So it
means third statement is wrong, by elimination, we've the
answer (a) only 
1.

111. (b) The process of decay, added by bacterial action,
transforms organic matter into humus. Humus enhances
water retention capacity of the soil. So, 1 is wrong. By
elimination we are left with Answer (b): 3 only.

112. (b) Sand Mining wrecks the intertidal area and creates
the imminent danger of saline water ingress into fresh
water." Meaning salinity will increase, so statement 1 is
wrong, by elimination we've answer (b) 2 and 3 only .
In this question, first statement is wrong, and you've
to identify right statements. So in real exam stress,
some students may have made error of reading / ticking,
and they'd have ticked the wrong option A: only 
1.
(you're right that it's wrong statement, but you're not
asked to tick the wrong one.) So, be mindful of ticking
in OMR.

113. (a) Studies have shown that increased concentrations of
carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant
growth…Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization
explains 70 percent of the greening effect. [NASA 2016]


Physical Geography B15

114. (c) NCERT Biology Class 12 page 127: “There was no
atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane,
carbondioxide and ammonia released from molten mass
covered the surface.” So #2 is wrong, CO2 was present,
we are left with (a) or (c). In both options first statement
is correct but experts were divided over third statement-
because early Early atmosphere of earth had no free
oxygen, the (life) forms until then could at best be only
“anaerobic”. So those living organisms did not have
capacity to alter the atmosphere, atleast not in a significant
manner. Accordingly, some ticked ‘a’ while others ticked
‘c’. UPSC has kept ‘c’ as the official answer.

115. (a) NCERT Class 6 Ch3, page 20:
• On 21st June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted
towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the
Tropic of Cancer. So, (c) and (d) are wrong.
• Places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous
daylight for about six months. So (a) is correct.

116. (d) As per the NASA webpage:
• Large amounts of methane are frozen in Arctic tundra
soils and in marine sediments including gas hydrates. As
Earth's climate warms, that methane is vulnerable to
possible release into the atmosphere, where it can add to
global warming. So 1 and 2 are correct.
• In Methane Cycle, every molecule of methane that
goes into the atmosphere remains there for 8 years until
it is removed by oxidation into carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water (H2O). So, 3 is also correct. This, answer (d): All
three correct.
117. (b) The favorable weather elements for dew include clear
skies, light wind, decent soil moisture. Clear skies allow
for the maximum release of longwave radiation to space.
Cloudy skies will reflect and absorb while re-emitting
longwave radiation back to the surface and that prevents
as much cooling from occurring. So (b) is the most
appropriate reason.

118. (b)
• OMT is measured up to a depth of 26 degree C
isotherm. During January–March, the mean 26 degree C
isotherm depth in the Southwestern Indian Ocean is 59
metres. So, #1 is wrong.
• Sea surface temperature (SST) is routinely used for
predicting whether the total amount of rainfall that India
receives during the monsoon season will be less or more
than the long-term mean. However, ocean mean
temperature (OMT) has better ability to predict this, than
SST. So, #2 is correct.

119. (c)
• Jet streams are high altitude westerly wind system
blows at a height of 6 to 14 km, with very high speed up
to 450 km/hr in wavy form at both hemispheres. So #1 is
wrong.
• Centre of the cyclone is called as Eye. The eye is a
Calm region with no rainfall and experiences highest
temperature and lowest pressure within the cyclonic
system. So #3 is wrong. So, by elimination, Answer is (c).

area which is suitable for raising a particular crop will be
selected, and raised with single variety of a kind. Suitable
area for seed production will be identified by the Scientists.
The foundation/ certified seeds or University labelled seeds
will be supplied by the University through Krishi Vigyan
Kendras (KVKs) and Research Stations at 50% subsidy
cost to the identified farmers in the area. The farmers will
use these quality seeds and take up their own seed
production in a small area (1 acre) for their own use. The
crops are Rice, Pulses and Oilseeds.

56. (c) Excessive/ inappropriate use of nitrogenous fertilizers
increase the acidity of soil and Leaching of nitrate to the
ground water.

57. (b) Agricultural Produce Market Committee Acts of
respective states are responsible for markets in agricultural
products.

58. (c) 'Agreement on Agriculture', 'Agreement on the
Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures' and
'Peace Clause' are related to World Trade Organisation.

59. (b) (i) In order to safeguard and support the world’s agri-
cultural heritage systems, in 2002 FAO started an initiative
for the dynamic conservation of Globally Important

Topicwise Solved PapersB58
Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). The GIAHS
Initiative promotes public under-standing, awareness,
national and international recognition of Agricultural
Heritage systems. It aims to identify and ensure global
recognition of the importance of unique traditional
agricultural systems for food security and sustainable
development. The GIAHS initiative explicitly recognises
that change in “traditional” political, social and economic
processes is inevitable; they cannot be frozen or
re-created.
(ii) There is no provision to give Geographical indication to
“ALL” varieties. Hence statement 3 is wrong. By
elimination method, we are left with answer (b) only 
2.

60. (c) (i) This initiative aims to demonstrate the improved
production and post-harvest technologies in an integrated
manner to catalyze increased production of millets in the
country. The scheme, through processing and value
addition techniques, is expected to generate consumer
demand for millet based food products. Poor, small,
marginal and tribal farmers have larger stake in this scheme.
(ii) 1st and 2nd statements are right. Policy aims to give free
kits but “wanting to shift commercial crop farmers to millet”
doesn’t fit logic. There is no such mention in the scheme,
nor any talk about giving micro-irrigation equipment.
Hence 3rd statement wrong.
Ref: http://agricoop.nic.in/Admin_Agricoop/Uploaded_
File/INSIMP .pdf

61. (b) A soil health card provides information about 12 soil
parameters, so farmer can use appropriate fertilizers. hence
only 3 is the correct statement. Statement 1 and 2 are
irrelevant.

62. (c) Both statements are correct as per Government
notification.

63. (c) According to the Kurukshetra Magazine November
2017 special issue on irrigation: Tillage exposes the soil
to drying, conversely, reductions in tillage help conserve
soil water. So #1 is right. The retention of crop residues
helps in reducing water loss from the soil to the air and
cools the soil. So, #3 is right. According to some random
research papers & Google books even gypsum application
helps in water conservation so experts ware divided
between Option (c) or (d). But in the official answer key
UPSC has kept (c) as the correct answer.

64. (d) Since UPSC has combined the preliminary exam of
civil services and forest services, so few such odd
questions are expected. There is no need to lose sleep, if
you can't solve it. But let's do it:
NCERT Class 12 Biology Chapter 6: "Molecular Basis of
Inheritance".
It explains the benefits of human genome sequencing
that- "It is the sequence of bases in DNA that determines
the genetic information of a given organism. So, learning
about the DNA sequences can lead to an understanding
of their natural capabilities that can be applied toward
solving challenges in health care, agriculture, energy
production, environmental remediation."
So on that logic, statement 1 and 3 should be possible,
and if 1 and 3 are possible then statement 2 ought to be
possible as well! So answer (d) all three statements are
correct. Searching academic papers on Google Scholar
engineer confirms that (d) is the answer.
65. (c) Kurukshetra February 2018 Issue on Agriculture, page
43 has given three key features of conservation agriculture
viz:
i. minimum soil disturbance by adopting no-tillage or
minimum tillage and reduced traffic for agricultural
operations. So, #2 is right. This eliminates Option (a)
ii. maximum soil cover by leaving crop residues on the
soil surface. So, #4 is right. This eliminates Option (d)
iii. adopt spatial and temporal crop sequencing/crop
rotation. So, #5 is verbatim right. Hence final answer (c)

66. (c) NCERT vocational class 11 floriculturist book page
84: When an element forms precipitate with another
substance commonly found in the irrigation water, it is
not advisable to use this method. Phosphorus and
anhydrous ammonia may form a precipitate in water with
high calcium and magnesium content. So they are not
u s e d i n f e r t i g a t i o n . S o 2 n d s t a t e m e n t i s w r o n g b y
elimination we arrived at the answer “c”.

67. (d)
• Open burning of crop residues in the agricultural
fields has become an environmental concern in India,
particularly during paddy harvesting season. ....The
Union government is providing subsidy for Happy
Seeders, Zero Till Seed Drill etc. which can help planting
the seeds for next crop without burning the previous
crop. So, #1 is correct. Ref: Economic Survey 2019-20
V olume 2 page 186-
189.
• In the zero tillage, We are not disturbing the soil
and we are not burning the previous crop Residue so
that way, it could help in Carbon sequestration. So, #3
should be correct.

68. (a)
• Sugarcane requires an annual rainfall between
75cm.and 100cm. Irrigation is required in the regions of
low rainfall. So, #C eliminated.
• Cotton requires high temperature, light rainfall or
irrigation, 210 frost-free days.
• Jute: requires high temperature, heavy rainfall and
humid climate
• Tea: requires cool climate and well distributed high
rainfall throughout the year
• Cotton: Cotton requires high temperature, light
rainfall, 210 frost-free days.
• Considering these descriptions, cotton seems to be
the better choice among the given options.

69. (d)
• Biochar is a stable, carbon–rich form of charcoal
that is applied to soil.
• biochars from manures and food wastes recorded
higher nitrogen and phosphorus levels. So #2 is right.
• Some biochars can increase soil fertility, water
holding capacity and crop productivity. So #3 is right
• T h e r e i s o n l y o n e o p t i o n w h e r e # 2 a n d # 3 a r e
together so answer is “d”.

by 86th Amendment Act (not 76th ).

45. (a) The above provision has been added by 91st
constitutional Amendment Act, 
2003.
46. (b) Statement 1 is incorrect as it is a Fundamental Right
under article 23 of Part III of the constitution. Statement 2
corresponds to Directive Principles of State Policy under
Article 47 under Part IV of the Constitution.

47. (b) Fifth schedule relates to the control and administration
of scheduled areas in states other than Tripura, Assam,
Meghalaya and Mizoram. While Sixth Schedule deals with
administration and control of tribal areas in the state of
Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura.

48. (c) 92nd Amendment Act 2003 added Bodo, Santhali, Maithali

51. (a) To vote in public elections is not a fundamental duty .

52. (b) Organizing village Panchayats and promoting cottage
industries in rural areas are the Gandhian principles that are
reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy.

53. (b) Rajyasabha can pass a resolution empowering the

56. (c) All the statements except 2 regarding the Fundamental

57. (c) Distribution of power between the Centre and the
States in the Indian Constitution is based on the
Government of India Act. 
1935.

58. (c) The members of the constituent Assembly from the
provinces were indirectly elected by the members of the
provincial assemblies, who themselves were elected on a
limited franchise.

59. (c) Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines to the
central and State government of India to be kept in mind
while framing laws and policies. DPSPs aim to create social
and economic conditions under which the citizens can lead a
good life. They also aim to establish social and economic
democracy through a welfare state. They act as a check on
the government. It is a yardstick in the hands of the people to
measure the performance of the government. It shall be the
duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws.

60. (d) An amendment to the constitution of India can be initiated
by an introduction of a bill in either house of the parliament.
If such an amendment seeks to make changes in the federal
character of the constitution, the amendment also requires
to be ratified by the legislature of at least half of the states.


Constitution & Political System C11

61. (d) National Development council is not a constitutional
body . It is an extra-constitutional body. Planning
Commission is a non-constitutional and non-statutory body.
It was created by the Govt. of India in 1950 by a resolution.
Zonal councils were set up under the states Re-Organization
Act, 1956 (So it is not a constitutional body) to faster inter-
state co-operation and co-ordination among the states.
Currently there are total five zonal councils viz Northern,
Western, Eastern, Central and Southern.

62. (b) Directive Principles of State Policy lays down that the
State shall take steps to organize village panchayats and
endow them with such powers and authority as may be
necessary to enable them to function as units of self
government. Planning for economic development and social
justice is one such power given to village panchayats. There
are 52 items in the concurrent list. Economic and social
planning is placed under entry no. 
20. Article -40 of the
constitution of India has the provision for organisation of
vilage panchayats Directive Principles of state policy lays
down that the state shall take steps to organise village
panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority
as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of
self government.
Accordingly village panchayats have been entrusted with
the task of preparation of plans for economic development
and social justice.
The national development council includes members of the
planning commission, but it is a separate body .

63. (b) The Preamble to the Constitution of India in its
introductory statement says- “Justice- Social, Economic and
Political” and the Directive Principles of state policies aim
to create social and economic condition under which the
citizens can lead a good life. They also aim to establish
social and economic democracy through a welfare state.

64. (d) The 52nd Amendment act of 1985, added 10th schedule
to the Constitution. This is often referred to as anti-defection
law.

65. (b) Promotion of international peace and security is
included in the Directive Principles of State Policy under
Article 51 of constitution that mentions to promote
international peace and security and maintain just and
honourable relations between nations between nations; to
foster respect for international law and treaty obligations,
and to encourage settlements of international disputes by
arbitration.

66. (a) The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India deals
with administration and control of scheduled areas and
scheduled tribes in these areas. The Sixth Schedule to the
Constitution of India contains provisions concerning the
administration of tribal areas in the States of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

67. (d) The Supreme Court of India is the apex court in India.
As stated by the Indian Constitution, the function of the
Supreme Court of India is that of the custodian of the
Constitution.

68. (d) The idea behind incorporation of fundamental duties
was to remind the citizens of the country that they have
certain obligations towards the country and society . Thefundamental duties were added to the constitution on the
recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee. There
were ten fundamental duties at the time of incorporation
but the eleventh was inserted by the 86th Amendment in

2002. To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and
integrity of India is one of the fundamental duty mentioned
in the constitution.

69. (b) A welfare state is a concept of the government in which
the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of
the economic and social well-being of its citizens.
The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) provides
guidelines to the central and the state governments of India,
to be kept in mind while framing laws and policies. The
concepts behind DPSP is to establish a "Welfare State"
rather than a "Police State" Such as of colonial era. In other
words, motive behind inclusion of DPSP is to establish social
and economic democracy rather than political democracy.

70. (c) Socio-economic democracy is spelt out because it
provides for the idea of a welfare state. For e.g. consider
Article 39 (b) and (c) which provide for minimizing
inequalities in income and wealth; and ensuring that the
wealth is not concentrated in the hands of few. While other
article provide for the health of children, rights of working
women etc. DPSP is not enforceable by courts. Only
fundamental rights can be enforced by the courts.

71. (d) If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in the
national interest that Parliament should make laws on a matter
in the State List, then the Parliament becomes competent to
make laws on that matter. Such a resolution must be passed by
the Rajya Sabha by a majority of not less than two-third of
its members present and voting.

72. (b) Read the preamble given in any school textbook:
"We, the people of India,....LIBERTY of thought,
expression, belief, faith and worship…"So, "B" is the
answer.

73. (a) Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, a member of the
Constituent Assembly, had said 'The Preamble to our
Constitution expresses what we had thought or dreamt so
long." So "A" is the answer.

74. (c) Prof.DD Basu classifies fundamental right in following
manner:
Right against
exploitationRight to equality
Cultural and
educational rightsSo 1 and 4 are fitting.Abolition of untouchability. S "2" is wrong in the
classification. This eliminates A and D.
Prohibition of human trafficking and forced Labour.
Prohibition of employment of children in factories etc.
Minorities rights.
So 3 is wrong in classification..
..
.
.
So by elimination, we are left with answer 1 and 4 only.

75. (c) New NCERT,Std. 11, Political Theory Chapter 5:
Rights , Page 72
•Through these rights, people make demands upon
the state. So, "C" is most fitting answer.

76. (d) S t a t e m e n t 1 : W h i l e F D s c a n b e e n f o r c e d b y
legislative processes (for e.g. Environment Protection Act
that helps enforce the individual duty of environment
protection), the constitution explicitly does not enforce
them via legal provisions or does not explicitly mention
in Part IVA that there are legislative processes to enforce

Topicwise Solved PapersC12
them. However, since the Parliament has enforced most
fundamental duties already via a legislative process, we
will consider this statement 1 as correct.
Statement 2: It is not clear what UPSC means by 'legal
duties', but for all practical purposes it can be considered
as 'law of the land'. FDs are in sync with legal duties
because what is illegal cannot be a fundamental duty, and
what is a fundamental duty has also been made a legal
duty (e.g. respecting women). Also it is an Indian citizen's
fundamental duty to abide by the constitutional laws
(legal duties); this brings the correlation. Statement 2 is
thus correct.

77. (a) Rights and duties are correlative and inseparable,
hence A is the answer.

78. (b) The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added four new
Directive Principles to the original list. They require the
State:

1. To secure opportunities for healthy development of
children (Article 39).

2. To promote equal justice and to provide free legal
aid to the poor (Article 39 A).

3. To take steps to secure the participation of workers
in the management of industries (Article 43 A).

4. To protect and improve the environment and to
safeguard forests and wild life (Article 48 A).

79. (d) The phrase 'Directive Principles of State Policy'
denotes the ideals that the State should keep in mind
while formulating policies and enacting laws. These are
the constitutional instructions or recommendations to the
State in legislative , executive and administrative matters.
Noted constitutional author Granville Austin considers
DPSP as " positive obligations " of the state. Since both
the statements are w ro ng, answ er is (d).

80. (a)
·First statement is correct. the 1st Amendment to the
constitution (1951) had inserted new Articles 31A and
31B and the Ninth Schedule, thus securing the
constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws by,
among other things, specifying that they could not be
challenged on the grounds that they violated the
Fundamental Rights. Subsequent governments have added
other progressive laws in the same, to give them immunity
from litigation. Government add the acts in the 9th
schedule, 'via parliament' so first statement is right.
· In I.R. Coelho case(2007), the Supreme Court ruled
that there could not be any blanketimmunity from judicial
review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule. So
statement#2 is WRONG

81. (b) Residuary powers were in the hands of Governor
General.

82. (b)
·Concept of Negative Liberty: Historically speaking, the
term liberty was initially defined as absence of all restraints
on an individual. John Stuart Mill, the nineteenth century
English political philosopher, described, "Restraint as an
evil". Mill was especially worried about the restraints
coming from the state and society. From this concept, we
can infer A: if there are more laws, there is less liberty.
· Concept of Positive Liberty: Since individuals live
together in a society, complete absence of restraints
would be neither possible nor desirable. It has been very
aptly said that your liberty to swing your arm ends there
where my nose begins. For liberty to be enjoyed byeveryone, it should have reasonable restraints. The
freedom of many requires restraint of law on the freedom
of some. Later liberals supported the positive liberty.
From this concept, we can infer B: if there are no laws,
there is no liberty.
· S o , a s s u c h , b o t h A a n d B ( a n d e v e n D ) s e e m
"appropriate", but question also asks which one reflects
both "appropriate" and "nicest"- Option B is the nicest
of them three.

83. (c) NCERT Political Science Textbook Class 11 ch.6
Judiciary, page 125
· This idea of rule of law implies that all individuals -
rich and poor, men or women, forward or backward castes
- are subjected to the same law. So, #2 is right. (Equality
before the law)
· The principal role of the judiciary is to protect rule
of law and ensure supremacy of law. It safeguards rights
of the individual…and ensures that democracy does not
give way to individual or group dictatorship. So, it also
means #1 and #4 are right.
· Statement #3 is irrelevant, so by elimination we are
left with Option (c)

84. (c) The Supreme Court ruled that "the right to privacy
is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and
personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the
freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution" so
Option c is right. [Ref: IndianExpress 2017-August]
Let's also look at the wrong options:
· Article 14- Gives the Right to Equality. 42nd
Constitutional Amendment Act 1976, is known as mini
constitution.
· Article 17- Related to the Abolition of Untouchability.
It is part of Right to Equality. Part IV- Directive Principles
of State Policy, does not have any mention about the
Privacy.
· Article 24- Prohibition of employment of children in
factories, et(c) 44th Constitution Amendment- 44th
amendment of the Constitution was enacted by the Janata
Government mainly to nullify some of the amendments
made by the 42nd Amendment Act, 
1976.

85. (b) "Keeping election of the Prime Minister beyond
judicial review" is a wrong statement 99th Amendment
had replaced the collegium system of appointing judges
to the Supreme Court and High Courts with a new body
called the National Judicial Appointments Commission
(NJAC). In 2015, SC held "ultra vires" the 99th
Constitutional Amendment Act and the NJAC Act. So, #2
is right. Answer B: only 
2.

86. (c)
 · The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to
admit motion for impeachment of SC Judges.
· The address to remove SC Judge must be supported
by a special majority of each House of Parliament (ie, a
majority of the total membership of that House and a
majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of
that House present and voting). So #4 is right, answer is
C.

87. (b) Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the
administration and control of scheduled areas. The
Governor can make regulations to prohibit or restrict the
transfer of land by or among members of the scheduled
tribes. So, B is the right answer.


Constitution & Political System C13

88. (b)
·Articles 124 to 147 in Part V of the Constitution deal
with the organisation, independence, jurisdiction, powers,
procedures and so on of the Supreme Court.
· 142 is an Article between 124-147 so, closest match
is B: related to Supreme Court.

89. (c) As per the bare act:
· In case of a woman who has two or more children,
the maternity benefit will continue to be 12 weeks. If less
than two children then she'll get 26 weeks paid leave.
· Every establishment with 50 or more employees to
provide crèche facilities within a prescribed distance. The
woman will be allowed four visits to the crèche in a day.
So #2 is wrong. We are left with Answer C: only 
3.

90. (d) The Constitution itself confers the power of judicial
review on the judiciary (both the Supreme Court as well
as High Courts). Judicial review is the power of the
judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative
enactments and executive orders of both the Central and
State governments. On examination, if they are found to
be violative of the Constitution (ultra vires), they can be
declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid (null and
void) by the judiciary. So #1 is wrong.
I.R. Coelho case (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that
there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial
review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule. Thus #2
is also wrong. So, D: neither 1 nor 2 correct

91. (b)
• Article 75: The ministers are collectively responsible
to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in
particular. The principle of collective responsibility implies
that the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry (i.e., council of
ministers headed by the prime minister) from office by
passing a vote of no confidence.
• So, b is the right choice.

92. (a) Directive principles of state policy are given in the
Part IV of the Indian Constitution (Article 36® 51). Within
that, Article 38 mentioned about State to secure a social
order for the promotion of welfare of the people.

93. (b)
• Constitution of India does not define the term ‘basic
structure’. It is a judicial tool that was invented by the
Supreme Court of India in the Keshavananda Bharti vs
State of Kerala (1973) landmark judgment.
• Even though, the Supreme Court invented the concept
of Basic Structure in the aforementioned judgment, it did
not define the same. However, it is only in the later
judgments that the court has added various elements to
the list of the basic structure of the Constitution.
• So, 1st statement is incorrect.
• Article 13 of the Indian Constitution deals with the
‘CONCEPT’ of Judicial Review however, it does not
explicitly mentions the term judicial review. But assuming
that question is asking in general sense, the answer should
be “b”: Only 2nd statement correct.
94. (a)
• Stateless Society: A society which lacks formal
institutions of government.
Gandhiji is a philosophical anarchist. Anarchist is one who
is opposed to every type of state; Gandhian Ramrajya is
that it is a self-regulating system where everyone is one’s
own ruler.
Marxism revolves a classless society and stateless society .
Karl Marx had predicted that the proletariats will take control
of the state and production, the, destroy all class
differences and class antagonisms, and finally resulting in
the ‘withering Away of the State’. Thus, the end result will
be a stateless society .
Thus, we can inform that both Gandhi & Marx aimed for
Stateless society .

95. (d) A.K. Gopalan vs State of Madras (1950): Supreme
Court ruled that Preamble is not enforceable in a court of
la w.
Berubari Vs Union (1960): Supreme Court ruled that
Preamble is not a part of the Indian Constitution however,
it helps in interpretation of the clauses of the Constitution.
Keshavananda Bharti vs State of Kerala (1973) ® Supreme
Court ruled that the Preamble is a part of the Indian
Constitution.
The combined effect of the 3 judgments has been that even
though the Preamble is a part of the Constitution, but it is
not enforceable in a court of law. However, the Preamble
helps in ascertaining the vision of the Constitution and
hence, independently, it is non-justiciable.

96. (d)
• Part-IV of the Indian Constitution deals with the
Directive Principles of the State Policy (Article 36 to Article
51)
Article 37: Provisions of Part-IV shall not be enforceable
by any court (Hence, 2nd statement is correct)
Article 37 of the Indian Constitution also states that it shall
be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making
laws as they are fundamental in the governance of the
country . So, #3 is correct. So, by elimination, the answer is d.

97. (d)
• Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
mentions about dignity of an individual. Preamble of Indian
Constitution speaks about “EQUALITY of status and of
opportunity; assuring the dignity of the individual and the
unity and integrity” So #1 is correct.
Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
mentions about the Right to Work. Similar concept in Article
41 of the Indian Constitution, under the head of DPSPs.
Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
mentions about duties. A similar concept that was inserted
in the Indian Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional
Amendment Act, 1976 under Part IV-A of the Constitution
(Article 51A).

by the constitution to resolve a deadlock between the two
houses over the passage of a bill.


Government & Administration (India & World) C27
The provision of joint sitting is applicable to ordinary bills
of financial bills only and not to Money bills or
constitutional amendment bills.

75. (a) When a money bill returns to the Loksabha with
amendments made by the Rajyasabha, it is open to Loksabha
to accept or to reject any or all of the recommendations.
When the Loksabha chooses to accept or decline the money
bill with or without the recommendation, the money bill is
deemed passed in both houses.

76. (c) No procedure has been laid down in the constitution
of India for the removal of a governor from his/her post.

to any of the matters enumerated with the Union List.
According to entry no 14 in the Union List it reads- ‘entering

implementing of treaties, agreement and convention with
foreign countries’.

79. (a) Minister/ministers can be removed by issuing no
confidence motion in the parliament. All cabinet members
are mandated by the constitution to be the member of either
house of the parliament of India. The cabinet is headed by
the prime minister and is advised by the cabinet secretary
who also acts as the head of Indian Administrative service.

80. (b) Article – 75 (4): The ministers Shall hold office
 during the pleasure of the president.
Article – 75 (5): The council of ministers shall be
collectively responsible to the Lok-Sabha.
Article–78 (2): Prime minister shall furnish such information
relating to the administration of the affairs of the union and
proposals for legislation on the president may call far.

81. (b) The first statement is not correct because its talks
about chairman as well as the deputy chairman. The Vice-
President of India is ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha.
Rajya Sabha also chooses from amongst its members, a
Deputy Chairman.
President: Elected members of parliament (MPs from Lok
Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha).
Elected members of State legislative members, including that
if NCT of Delhi and Pondicherry.
Vice President: Vice President is elected indirectly , by an
electoral college consisting of members of both houses of
the parliament. The second statement is correct.

82. (a) Clause (3) of Article 77 (“Conduct of Business of the
Government of India”) of the Constitution of India lays down
as follows: “The President shall make rules for the more
convenient transaction of the business of the Government
of India, and for the allocation among Ministers of the said
business.
The Constitution of India mentions that, “All executive
action of the Government of India shall be expressed to be
taken in the name of the President.” Therefore, only option
(a) is correct.

83. (b) It is the Parliament which has the power to increase
the number of judges in the Supreme Court of India.
Parliament increased the number of judges from the original
eight in 1950 to eleven in 1956, fourteen in 1960, eighteen in
1978, twenty-six in 1986 and thirty-one in 
2008.
84. (c) Article 75 says that the Council of Ministers shall be
collectively responsible to Loksabha. In other words, Lok
Sabha can remove them by passing a no-confidence motion.
But the word “no confidence motion” itself is not mentioned
in Constitution. It comes from Rule 198 of Lok Sabha Rules.
Rajya Sabha cannot pass or remove council of ministers by
passing no-confidence motion. No confidence motion can
be introduced, only in Lok Sabha.

85. (b) The largest Committee is the committee of Estimates,
given its 30 members
Committee on No. of members
Public Accounts 22
Estimates 30
Public Undertakings 22
Petitions LS(15) , RS(10)

86. (b) The governor has Constitutional discretion in cases
of Reservation of bill for consideration of the President and
Recommendation of the imposition of President's
rule.Therefore, statement 1 and 3 are definitely right. Moreover
Governor only appoints those persons as ministers who are
recommended by the Chief Minister. So Governor doesn’t
have “Discretion” in appointment of the minister.Therefore 2
is wrong .

87. (c) The functions of the Cabinet Secretariat includes
preparation of agenda for Cabinet Meetings & Secretarial
assistance to Cabinet Committees. However Allocation of
financial resources to the Ministries as per the provisions
in budget is the task of finance ministry.

88. (c) A constitutional Government needs to balance
between individual liberty viz a viz State Authority.

89. (d) The maximum strength of the legislative council is fixed
at one third of the total strength of the legislative assembly
and the minimum strength is fixed at

legislative council is elected by the council itself from
amongst its members.

of finance is responsible for the preparation of union Budget
that is presented to the parliament.
• Consolidated fund of India is a fund to which all
receipts are credited and all payments are debited.
• No money can be appropriated (issued or drawn) out
of the consolidated fund of India without the authorization
from the parliament of India.
Public account of India is operated by executive action,
that is, the payments from this account can be made without
parliamentary appropriation. Such payments are mostly in
the nature of banking transactions.

91. (d) The executive in a Parliamentary system is responsible
1to the legislature for all its actions. The ministers are
answerable to the parliament and responsible to the Lok
Sabha. The Council of Ministers remains in office as long
as they enjoy the support and confidence of the Lok Sabha.

92. (b) A Money Bill cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha.
Rajya Sabha has no power either to reject or amend a Money
Bill. It can only make recommendations on the Money Bill.
Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on the
demands for grants ( which is the exclusive privilage of the
Lok-Sabha.

93. (a) In India, if a bill has been rejected by any house of the
parliament and if more than six months have elapsed, the

Topicwise Solved PapersC28
President may summon a joint session for purpose of
passing the bill. The bill is passed by a simple majority of a
joint sitting. Joint sitting is an extra-ordinary machinery
provided by the constitution to resolve a deadlock between
the two houses over the passage of a bill.
If the bill in dispute is passed by a majority of the total
number of member both the houses present and voting in
the joint sitting, the bill is deemed to have been passed by
both the houses.

94. (d) The Executive powers of the Union of India is vested
in the President. The Cabinet Secretary (and not the Prime
Minister) is the ex-officio head of the Civil Services Board.

95. (a) NEW NCERT Class 8 Civics, Chapter 3, page 32
The take-off point for a democracy is the idea of consent,
i.e. the desire, approval and participation of people. It is
the decision of people that creates a democratic
government and decides about its functioning.
So, since democracy requires voters' decision making-
hence intelligence and character are called in. hence
answer "A"

96. (a) NEW NCERT Class 11, Political Science, page 
45.
• First step towards bringing about equality is of course
ending the formal system of inequality and privileges .
The caste system in India prevented people from the
'lower' castes from doing anything except manual labour.
In many countries only people from some families could
occupy high positions. Attainment of equality requires
that all such restrictions or privileges should be brought
to an end.

97. (b) MIND IT: you've to find the wrong statements here-
they're the right answers.
• when the President's Rule is imposed in a state, the
President dismisses the state council of ministers headed
by the chief minister. The state governor, on behalf of the
President, carries on the state administration with the help
of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors appointed
by the President. Meaning "2" is definitely the
consequence of proclamation. Hence all options involving
"2" are wrong. Hence by elimination we are left with
answer "B": 1 and 3 only.

98. (d) Indian federation is not the result of an agreement
among the states unlike the American federation. So, "D"
is not the feature of Indian federalism.

99. (b) Balwant Rai G Mehta Committee submitted its report
in November 1957 and recommended the establishment of
the scheme of 'democratic decentralisation', which
ultimately came to be known as Panchayati Raj.

100. (c) New NCERT, Std. 11, Introduction to Indian
Constitution, page 91: Parliamentary system is also known
as Cabinet Government. It provides for collective
responsibility of the executive to the legislature.Hence
answer "C".

101. (c) NCERT Class 9: Democratic Polities page 87: "Since
it is not practical for all ministers to meet regularly and
discuss everything, (hence) the decisions are taken in
Cabinet meetings. That is why parliamentary democracy
in most countries is often known as the Cabinet from of
government." Therefore, some expert felt that cabinet from
of Government helps in work distribution and thereby
speeding up efficiency so B is the right answer. However,
other experts went by the interpretation given in M.
Laxmikanth's book on Indian Polity: "Parliamentary systemis also known as cabinet Government. It provides for
collective responsibility of the executive to the legislature."
So should be the answer. UPSC has kept 'C' as the official
answer.

102. (d) The Parliament exercises control over the ministers
through various devices like question hour , discussions,
adjournment motion , no confidence motion, etc. and
Supplementary questions can be asked during the
question hour.Therefore, all three are correct.

103. (d) Private member's bill as a bill introduced by any
member of the parliament who's not a minister. Hence first
statement is wrong.
• The Indian Express report in 2016 says only 14 private
members bill have been passed since 
1952. So statement
2 is also wrong.

104. (c) For election to the Lok Sabha, a nomination paper
can be filed by any citizen of India whose name appears
in the electoral roll of a constituency.

105. (d) New NCERT, Std. 11, Introduction to Indian
Constitution Chapter 3: Election and Representation, Page
57: India has first past the post system wherein a candidate
who wins the election may not (need to) get majority
(50%+1) votes. Statement #1 is wrong.
Upto the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the
Deputy Speaker were usually from the ruling party. Since
the 11th Lok Sabha, there has been a consensus that the
Speaker comes from the ruling party (or ruling alliance)
a n d t h e p o s t o f D e p u t y S p e a k e r g o e s t o t h e m a i n
opposition party.Meaning it's an 'informal consensus'
among political parties, and not Constitutional provision.
Hence, statement 2 is wrong.

106. (c) New NCERT Class 9: Democratic Politics, Page 109:
Right to vote in elections is an important constitutional
right .
New NCERT, Std. 11 , Introduction to Indian Constitution,
Page 66 one of the important decisions of the framers of
India Constitution was to guarantee every adult citizen in
India, the right to vote. [Article 326]
Combining the interpretation of both textbooks, "C" is the
answer.

107. (d) Election Commission has three election
Commissioners.
Election Commission decides the election schedule for
the conduct of both general elections and bye-elections.
It also decides the disputes relating to splits/mergers of
recognized political parties.
Hence answer "D" only 
3.

108. (b) 2 only
· The results of the first general election did not
surprise anyone…Congress party won 364 of the 489
s e ats in the f irs t L o k S ab ha and f inis he d w ay ahe ad o f
any other challenger. The Communist Party of India that
came next in terms of seats won only 16 seats. [NCERT
Class12: Politics in India since Independence, p30]. So,
statement#1 is wrong
· In the remaining options b and c, both contain
statement#2, so as such we've to accept it as true, and no
need to waste time finding proofs, Nonetheless, to satiate
the curiosity: It was Ram Subhag Singh- who became the
first leader of opposition in Lok Sabha in 
1969. Ref: Indian
Express


Government & Administration (India & World) C29
· In each House of Parliament, there is the 'Leader of the
Opposition'. The leader of the largest Opposition party having
not less than one-tenth seats of the total strength of the
House is recognized as the leader of the Opposition in that
House. maximum strength of the Lok Sabha is fixed at 552
so minimum 10% doesn't translate to 75 in any case. Hence
statement#3 is wrong, by elimination, we get Answer (b)

109. (b)
· Committee on government assurances- checks the
assurances, promises and undertakings given by ministers
from time to time on the floor of the House and reports
on the extent to which they have been carried through.
In the Lok Sabha, it consists of 15 members and in the
Rajya Sabha, it consists of 10 members. It was constituted
in 
1953.
· Committee on Subordinate legislation examines and
reports to the House whether the powers to make
regulations, rules, sub-rules and bye-laws delegated by
the Parliament or conferred by the Constitution to the
Executive are being properly exercised by it. In both the
Houses, the committee consists of 15 members. It was
constituted in 
1953.
· Rules committee considers the matters of procedure
and conduct of business in the House and recommends
necessary amendments or additions to the rules of the
House. The Lok Sabha committee consists of 15 members
including the Speaker as its ex-officio chairman. In the Rajya
Sabha, it consists of 16 members including the Chairman as
its ex-officio chairman
· Business advisory committee regulates the programme
and time table of the House. It allocates time for the
transaction of legislative and other business brought
before the House by the government. The Lok Sabha
committee consists of 15 members including the Speaker
as its chairman. In the Rajya Sabha, it has 11 members
including the Chairman as its ex-officio chairman.

110. (c)
· Article 110(1)(A): a Bill shall be deemed to be

to imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation
of any tax.
· Article 110(1)(c): the custody of the Consolidated Fund
or the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys
into or the withdrawal of moneys from any such Fund.
· Article 110(1)(g) any matter incidental to any of the
matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) depending on
how you interpret these provisions, it is difficult to outline
any of the given statement as a wrong statement. But, UPSC
has kept ‘C’ as the official answer.

111. (a) Statement 1- Correct: Value of 1 MLA’s vote is
based on total population of state to be divided by the
total MLAs. Hence it ought to vary from state to state.
Statement 2- vaguely worded, and open to multiple
interpretation: Interpretation 2(i): While the value of an
MLA’s vote depends on the population of the state he
or she belongs to, the value of an MP’s vote remains the
same at 708 so statement#2 is wrong. However if you
interpret it as ‘collective’ value then LS has more seats
than RS, the (collective) value of vote of MPs of LS > RS
then #2 should be right. Accordingly, experts were dividedo v e r a n s w e r A o r C . U P S C h a s a l s o k e p t ‘ A ’ a s t h e
official answer.

112. (a)
· The Speaker is elected by the assembly itself from
amongst its members. Usually, the Speaker remains in
office during the life of the assembly. However, he vacates
his office earlier in any of the following three cases: 
1. if
h e c e a s e s t o b e a m e m b e r o f t h e a s s e m b l y … . . S o
statement#1 is right.
· Constitution of India, Art 179: "…Provided further
that, whenever the Assembly is dissolved, the Speaker
shall not vacate his office until immediately before the
first meeting of the Assembly after the dissolution." So,
statement#2 is wrong.

113. (c)
· Governor enjoys personal immunity from legal liability
for his official acts. During his term of office, he is immune
from any criminal proceedings, even in respect of his
personal acts. He cannot be arrested or imprisone(d)
· His emoluments and allowances cannot be
diminished during his term of office. Thus both statements
are right.

114. (b) The President's Rule can be proclaimed under Article
356… He can declare that the powers of the state legislature
are to be exercised by the Parliament. So "B" is the right
answer.

115. (a)
· "Article 31B along with the Ninth Schedule was
added by the 1st Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951
to reduce the scope of Judicial review in the matters of
land reforms and Zamindari-Abolition. Originally (in 1951),
the Ninth Schedule contained only 13 acts and regulations
but at present (in 2016) their number is 
282."
· So, if it was made the 50s, then it must be the Prime
Minister Nehru.

116. (a) If 'Office of Profit' was well defined in Constitution,
then there wouldn't have been controversies related to
AAP-MLAs' disqualification (2018-Jan), and Kejriwal &
Co. wouldn't have been running from pillar to post between
EC and SC to prevent their disqualification. So, #3 is
wrong, and by elimination we are left with Answer A:1
and 2 only.

117. (c)
· Governor can address the state legislature at the
commencement of the first session after each general
election and the first session of each year. So #1 is right.
· Article 208 of the Constitution: A House of the
Legislature of a State may make rules for regulating subject
to the provisions of this Constitution, its procedure and
the conduct of its business. Thus, it’s not mandated in the
Constitution for the State legislature to (ALW AYS) follow
/ copy the rules of Lok Sabha. So, #2 is wrong. Thus, answer
A: only 
1.
· Counterview: As per IndianExpress Article in 2016-
September, second statement is correct so answer should
be C: Both 1 and 
2.
· Final verdict: UPSC official Answerkey says “C: both
statements are correct”.
118 (c) Centre-State relations:
· While selecting Governors, the Central Government

Topicwise Solved PapersC30
should adopt the following strict guidelines as
recommended in the Sarkaria Commission report: He
should be a detached figure and not too intimately
connected with the local politics of the states.

119. (a)
· Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission was
setup for a limited time period under Justice B.N.
Srikrishna's chairmanship. And its mandate did not include
reviewing the electricity regulator. #4 is wrong. Similar
reason eliminates Finance Commission (#3) which is setup
periodically for the tax distribution between Union and
States. Thus B and C are eliminated.
· NITI Ayog is a think tank and policy advisor for the
Government. Yes, it reviews development work in the
Aspirational districts and SDG implementation across India
but reviewing independent regulators is not under its
purview. So, #5 is wrong. This eliminates D. Thus by
elimination, we are left with Answer A: only 1 and 
2.

120. (d)
· Historically speaking, the term liberty was initially
defined as absence of all restraints on an individual.
This is kno w n as the negative concept o f lib erty . Early
liberalism championed negative liberty. John Stuart Mill,
the nineteenth century English political philosopher,
described, “Restraint as an evil”. So, (d) is appropriate.
· However, after the examination, many of the coaching
classes felt that answer should be “b” based on another
interpretation by D.D.Basu.
But as per the official UPSC Answerkey , correct answer is
“d”.

121. (d) Bureaucrats are appointed by the President / Governor
of India for implementing the policies of the government of
the day . Other options are less suitable.

122. (a,d) (why two answers possible)
As per the Representation of People Act, 1951, a person
convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment
for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the
date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified
for a further period of six years since his release. There is
no clause of “permanent disqualification” in the
Representation of Peoples Act, 
1951. Hence, 2nd statement
is incorrect. So, answer could be (a) or (d). It all depends on
the validity of the first statement#
1.
According to some experts, #1 is right because
· A citizen becomes eligible to vote upon attaining the
age of 
18.
· Whereas to become a member of the Vidhan Sabha,
he must be minimum 25 years old.
· Article 164(4) of the Indian Constitution ® A Minister
who for any period of six consecutive months is not a
member of the Legislature of the State shall at the expiration
of that period cease to be a Minister.
· So, accordingly , some experts interpret that even 18
or 19 year old person (Who is eligible to vote), can become
minister for atleast 6 months. So#1 is right.
· Other experts differ, that “since Constitution itself has
not specifically said this, so statement#1 is wrong”, so
answer is “d”.
· Final judge: we’ve to wait for the official answerkey
of UPSC
123. (a,c)
· Article 85 of the Indian Constitution empowers the
President to summon each house of the Parliament at such
time and place as he thinks fit. (Hence, 1st statement is
correct)
· The Constitution of India does not mention the
anything about the number of Parliamentary sessions in a
year. (Hence, 2nd statement is incorrect)
· There is some ambiguity in the 3rd statement.
· If the UPSC interprets it in a narrow and literal sense,
then exact number of days for which the Parliament is
supposed to meet in a year is not mentioned in the
Constitution and hence, 3rd statement is correct.
· However, if we interpret the question in a broader
manner, then Article 85 of the Indian Constitution mentions
that 6 months shall not intervene the 2 sessions of the
Parliament. Interpreting this clause, it essentially means
that Parliament has to meet at least for 2 days in a year to
prevent the violation of Article 
85. In such a scenario, 3rd
statement is incorrect.

124. (b)
• Article 312: With regards to the creation of All India
Services, Rajya Sabha has special powers such that if Rajya
Sabha is passing a resolution by a majority of 2/3rd of the
members present and voting, Parliament may, by law, create
one or more All India Services in national interest. So A is
wrong.
· Article 75(3) hold the government collectively
responsible to the Lok Sabha. Hence, in this regards, Lok
Sabha has greater power as compared to Rajya Sabha. So
C is wrong.
· Cut Motions, which are meant to reduce the amount
allocated to the ministries in the demand for grants, can be
made only in Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha can only make
recommendations with regards to the cut motion. So d is
wrong. Article 368 of the Indian Constitution, a bill to amend
the Constitution can be introduced in either house of the
Parliament and both the houses have equal powers in
respect to the Constitutional Amendment Bill. So b is right.

125. (d) In India, the constitutional government is a limited
government. The powers of the government are limited by
means of the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Part-III
of the Indian Constitution, that are essentially given to us
against the state actions.

126. (b)
· During the Expansionary Money / Cheap Money /
Dovish Monetary Policy , RBI will try to increase the supply
of money and/or reduce the loan interest rates.
· So reducing the SLR, bank rate and repo rate will help
in that regard. So, RBI may do 1 and 
3. So, here question is
asking, “WHAT RBI WILL NOT DO?” So, Option a, c and
d are eliminated. we are left with answer b: Only 
2.
· Increasing the MSF will raise the loan interest rates,
so, if RBI pursues Expansionary policy, it’ll not do it.
· Some candidates engage in hairsplittery ( cky dh [kky
fudkyuk ), that under the external benchmark system, loans
are linked with repo rate so #2 unlikely to have any impact.
But such hairsplittery is not required for the scope of exam

are terminated by non-renewal of contract. So, #1 is right.
• No notice of termination of employment shall be
necessary in the case of temporary workman. So, #2 is right.
Answer C: both correct.

33. (a) This act establishes the National and State
Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and
Planning Authorities to manage the National and State
Funds. But, in the bare act there is no mention of mandatory
People's participation so, #2 is wrong. Thus answer A: only
1 correct.

34. (d)
•15 percent of MPLADS funds are to be utilized for
areas inhabited by SC population and 
7.5 per cent for
areas inhabited by ST population. So, #2 is correct. b
eliminated.
•The funds released under the Scheme are non-
lapsable, i.e., the entitlement of funds not released in a
particular year is carried forward to the subsequent
years, subject to eligibility . So, #3 is wrong. Upon
reading the official guidelines page 34: District Authority
would inspect at least 10% of the works under
implementation every year. So, #4 is right answer
therefore Answer is d.

Article 23 and 24-Right against Exploitation. Article 25to28
- Right to Freedom of Religion. Article 29 and 30-Cultural
and Educational Rights.

30. (c) All statements are correct.

31. (a) Fundamental Rights available only to citizens and not

28.
Article 19(1) (g) of constitution of India provides Right to

groups: Right to Equality (14-18), Right to Freedom (19-22),
Right against Exploitation (23 and 24), Right to Freedom ofReligion (25 and 28), Cultural & Educational Rights (29 and
30), Right to Constitutional remedies (32).

33. (d) Right to Constitutional Remedies under article 32 is a
Fundamental Right. It was called the very soul of Indian
constitution and very heart of it, by B.R. Ambedkar.

34. (a) Article 301 pertains to Freedom of Trade, Commerce
and Intercourse. In the original constitution right to
property was a Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)
(f). But 44th Amendment Act, 1978 omitted sub clause f,
and inserted Article 300A to make right to property a
legal right.

nomination of religious Minorities to the Lok-Sabha.
However religious minorities can avail benefits from the
prime minister’s 15-point programme.

38. (d) Disable students come under the Right to Education
and RTE Act provides for free and compulsory education to
‘children’ between the ages six and 14 years, though under
the Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, a child refers to a
person up to the age of 18 years. So statement 1 is correct.
Please note that Persons with Disability (PWD) Act provides
for ramps in public building; adaptation of toilets for wheel
chair users; Braille symbols and auditory signals in elevators
or lifts; ramps in hospitals, primary health centres and other
medical care and rehabilitation institutions. The same Act
also states that appropriate Governments and local

Topicwise Solved PapersC42
(i) The centre and one or more states; or
(ii) The centre and any state or states on one side and one
or more states on the other; or
(iii) Between two or more states.
In the above federal disputes, the supreme court has
exclusive original jurisdiction. Meaning, no other count can
decide such disputes.

42. (b) Each Gram Nyayalaya is a court of Judicial Magistrate
of the first class and its presiding officer is appointed by
the state government in consultation with the High court.
Gram Nyayalaya Act; 2008 came into force of Oct, 2, 
2009.
The objective of this Act is to Provide inexpensive justice
to people in rural areas at their doorsteps.
· Gram Nyayalaya try criminal cases, civil suits, claims
or disputes which are specified in the First Schedule and
the Second Schedule of the Gram Nyayalaya Act the
Act.The Gram Nyayalaya are supposed to try to settle the
disputes as far as possible by bringing about conciliation
between the parties and for this purpose, it can make use of
the appointed conciliators. 
· Reference- Page no. 601 of India year book 2016,
under heading Judiciary it says- Panchayat Courts also
function in some states under various names like Nyaya
Panchayat, Panchayat Adalat, Gram Kachehri, etc., to
decide civil and criminal disputes of petty and local nature.
That means first statement is wrong.
· Under this act, District court with consultation of DM,
prepares panel of social workers to act as councilors.
Hence 2nd statement is right.

43. (a) New NCERT, Std. 11, Indian Constitution at Work,
Chapter-6 Judiciary, Page 139
• Judicial review means the power of SC or HC to
examine the constitutionality of any law. So, "A" is the
most fitting option.

44. (d) Topic was in news during 2018-March: The World
Justice Project released its Rule of Law Index 2017-18
report, which measures the extent to which 113 countries
have adhered to the rule of law in that perio(d) (India's
rank was 62, better than China, Pakistan, Myanmar and
Bangladesh; Denmark occupied the top spot. Ref:

45. (b)
· Under RTE Act section 23, National Council for
Teacher Education (NCTE) decides the minimum
qualification. So, #1 is wrong.
· After RTE it is mandatory that only those people
may be appointed as teachers who are able to clear TET.
So, #2 is right. Thus by elimination, we get the correct
answ er b : o nly 
2.

46. (b)
• Indian Forest Act was amended to omit the word
"bamboos" from the definition of tree, to exempt bamboos
grown on non-forest area from the requirement of permit
for felling or transit under the said Act, and would
encourage bamboo plantation by farmers resulting in the
enhancement of their income from agricultural fields. So,
#1 is wrong.
• In both b and c, statement #3 is common, so we've
to accept it as true without verifying.
Forest rights Act: Section 2(i) Minor forest produce
includes bamboo, brushwood, honey, wax etc. So, #2 is
right. Thus answ er is b .

47. (b) 2018-April: "The right to marry a person of one's
choice is integral to Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of
the Constitution". SC Judgement on Hadiya Case. Then

“Equality”:
• Article 14 ® Equality before law
• Article 15 ® Prohibition of discrimination on
grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth
• Article 16 ® Equality of opportunity in matters of
public employment
• Article 17 ® Abolition of untouchability
• Article 18 ® Abolition of titles

49. (a) AS per the official page of NALSA: senior citizens
eligible depending on income. So, #4 “ALL senior
citizens eligible” is wrong. b and d eliminated.
As per the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 ® There is
no provision of free legal aid for OBCs. (This eliminates
the 3rd Statement) So, answer a: 1 and 2 only .

production, employment, real income and wholesale-retail
trade. Depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in
economic activity . In economics, a depression is commonly
defined as an extreme recession that lasts two or more years.
Economic Recovery is a period of increasing business
activity signaling the end of a recession. Much like a
recession, an economic recovery is not always easy to
recognize until at least several months after it has begun.

33. (d) The National Human Development Report 2001, is an
attempt to map the state of human development in India.
While considering the state of human development, and
the related economic, educational and health attainments,
the report analyses governance for human development.
To facilitate monitoring, many process indicators have been
created. The Human Development Index, Gender Disparity
Index and Human Poverty Index have been calculated for
India after modifying the UNDP methodology .

34. (d) Megacities of India have more than 5 million
population. But not all the major megacities are located on
the sea coast or are sea ports. Delhi, which is the national
capital is not a sea port.

35. (b) Kandla Port handled the highest volume of traffic at
(
81.12 MT), followed by paradip (
74.40MT), JNPT (
48.89
MT) Mumbai (
47.53 MT) and Visakhapatnam (
46.56 MT)
during April to December 2017

36. (d) According to the table given above, the life expectancy
at birth in India is not same as that of Indonesia. India
= 
62.4, Indonesia = 
64.

37. (d) Per capita real income is nothing but NNP at factor
cost. It means national income is sum total of all factor
incomes adjusted for increase in prices.

38. (a) Revenue deficit = revenue receipts – Revenue
expenditure; Budget deficit = Total receipts – Total
expenditure; Fiscal deficit = Revenue receipts + Non-debt
creating capital receipts – Total expenditure (F.D. is
government borrowings); Primary deficit = Fiscal deficit
 – Interest payments.

39. (b) Indirect taxes are the charges that are levied on goods
and services. Some of the significant indirect taxes include
V alue Added Tax, Central Sales Tax, Central Excise Duty ,
Customs Duty, stamp duties and expenditure tax. Property tax,
Corporation tax and Wealth tax are examples of direct taxes.

Topicwise Solved PapersD10
farmer and to create a buffer stock of food grains to meet
public distribution system requirements.

43. (b) Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana was launched in
order to achieve the objective of sustainable human
development at the village level. It has 6 components viz.,
primary health, Primary education, rural shelter, rural drinking
water, nutrition and Rural electrification. Upto 100% FDI is
allowed in respect of projects relating to electricity
generation, transmission and distribution, other than atomic
reactor power plants.

44. (c) Public Finance in India also comes under the purview
of a branch of economics which determines and assesses
the policies of the Indian government stipulated in the
annual finance budget.
It identifies that types and consequences of tax measures
and expenditure on citizens, institutions, and the entire
economy . The upward trend in the ratio of Fiscal Deficit of
GDP a recent years has an adverse effect on private
investment. The continued high borrowing has kept the
real interest rates high in the economy . Public finance
identifies that types and consequences of tax measures and
expenditure on citizens, institutions, and the entire economy .

45. (d) Capital account convertibility means free conversion
of cross-border capital flows, implying that anybody can
convert domestic currency into hard currency at the market

female literacy of 
51.85, Orissa has 
50.51%, Madhya Pradesh
- 
50.29 and Rajasthan has

75.3 and 
74.7 respectively .

50. (d) As per census 2001, child sex ratio in Haryana was
861, in Punjab 876 and in Sikkim 
875. Hence, Haryana and
Sikkim were the two states with lowest sex ratios. The
population per sq. km. of area in Arunachal Pradesh was 13,
in Meghalaya was 103 and in Mizoram was 
42. Hence, the
two states with the lowest population per sq. km of area are
Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Kerala has both the highest
literacy rate and sex ratio.

51. (b) In 1999, the IMF established the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) to make the objectives of
poverty reduction and growth more central to lending
operations in its poorest member countries.

52. (c) Fiscal responsibility and budget management act aims

18.5%
54. (b) Participatory Notes (PNs / P-Notes) are instruments
used by investors or hedge funds that are not registered
with the SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) to
invest in Indian securities. Participatory notes are
instruments that derive their value from an underlying
financial instrument such as an equity share and, hence,
the word, ‘derivative instruments’. SEBI permitted FIIs to
register and participate in the Indian stock market in 
1992.

55. (d) Rice production was 
96.69 Million tonnes in

Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS)
under National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) in the
year

provide social protection to the eligible beneficiaries. In
this article, we look at the Indira Gandhi National Old Age
Pension Scheme in detail.

57. (d) Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) was the tax applied to most,
although not all, fringe benefits. A new tax was imposed on
employers by India’s Finance Act 2005 and was introduced

Benefit Tax was abolished in the Finance Bill of 
2009.
Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is the tax payable on the
value of taxable securities transaction. STT was introduced
in India by the 2004 budget and is applicable with effect

imposition and collection of interest tax. The Act applies to
all scheduled Banks that are required to pay tax on the
chargeable interest amounts they have on their deposits.
The act is no longer applicable with regard to chargeable
interest accruing after 31 March 
2000.

58. (c) Deflation is a decrease in the prices of goods and
services. It occurs when the annual inflation rate falls below
0% which is a negative inflation rate. This is different from
Disinflation which is a slow-down in the inflation rate. This
is a situation when inflation declines to lower levels but
prices continue to rise.

59. (c) ADR is an American Depositary Receipt which
represents ownership in the shares of a non-US company
that trades in U. S. financial markets.
GDR is Global Depositary Receipt is a bank certificate issued
in more than one country for shares in a foreign company. A
GDR is very similar to ADR. SDR is special Drawing Rights.

instead of every week. The base year was changed to 2004-
05 from 1993-
94. However data on primary and fuel items


Structure of the Indian Economy & Demographics D11
was continued to release on a weekly basis. Consumer Price
Index food group has a weight of 
39.1 percent as compared
to the combined weight of 
24.4 percent (food articles and
Manufactured food products) in wholesale Price Index food
basket.

62. (b) Recession is a period of temporary economic decline
during which trade and industrial activity are reduced,
generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive
quarters.
Slow down is a period of slow economic growth, especially
one that follows a period of robust growth
Melt down follows normally a black swan event and quickly
results is financial assets loosing in vlaue, often resulting
in liquidity crisis. The stock market in India suffered melt
down from Sensex 20,000 in mid 2008 to 10,000 in mid 
2009.

63. (d) Over the past few decades, it has been the private
sector that has really driven capacity-creation in Indian
higher education. Serious thinking on downsizing
bureaucracy had begun in the early 1990s. A sub-group set
up by the Planning Commission had suggested in 1993 that
the Union government should weed out at least 2,000 senior-
level positions in various ministries.

64. (b) The correct answer is (b).

65. (b) The demographic dividend is a rise in the rate of
economic growth due to a rising share of working age people
in a population. This usually occurs late in the demographic
transition when the fertility rate falls and the youth
dependency rate declines.
66. (d) V A T, being a 'tax on sale or purchase of goods within a
State' is a State Subject by virtue of Entry 54 of State List of
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Since
V A T/Sales tax is a State subject, the Central Government
has been playing the role of a facilitator for successful
implementation of V AT.

67. (d) Darwin’s “struggle for existence” in natural history is
analogous to the class struggle in “human History”. So
option (c) stands incorrect. The sketch of dialectical
materialism given by Karl Marx explains that Dialectical
principle is of universal application and all the development
is “struggle of opposites” or “conflict of opposites”. Thus
option d stands correct in this question.

68. (c) Under Article 266 (1) of the Constitution of India, all
revenues ( example tax revenue from personal income tax,
corporate income tax, customs and excise duties as well as
non-tax revenue such as licence fees, dividends and profits
from public sector undertakings etc.) received by the Union
government as well as all loans raised by issue of treasury
bills, internal and external loans and all moneys received by
the Union Government in repayment of loans shall form a
consolidated fund.

69. (c) The Base effect refers to the tendency of a small
change from a low initial amount to the current amount which

Co-operative Banks – 30%
RRB and others – 10%

72. (a) 
1. Placing Annual Financial Statement before the
Parliament

2. Withdrawal of moneys from Consolidated Fund of India
only after passing the Appropriation Bill

3. Provisions of supplementary grants and vote-on-account

5. Introducing Finance Bill in the Parliament

73. (d) All the statements are correct.

74. (a) Deficit financing refers to the difference between
expenditure and receipts. In public finance, it means the
govt. is spending more than what it is earning. Deficit
financing is a necessary evil in a welfare state as the states
often fail to generate tax revenue which is sufficient enough
to take care of the expenditure of the state. The basicintention behind deficit financing is to provide the necessary
impetus to economic growth by artificial means.

75. (d) Priority sector lending constitutes the lending to–
agriculture, micro and small enterprises, micro credit,
education, housing and weaker sections.

76. (b) In India’s foreign exchange reserve, it includes foreign
currency deposits, bonds, gold reserves, SDRs and IMF
reserve position. Foreign exchange reserves are an important
part of the international investment position of a country .

77. (d) National Income is the money value of all the final
goods and services produced by a country during a period
of one year. National Income consists of a collection of
different types of goods and services of different types.

78. (b) Capital Account comprises of Foreign loans, Foreign
Direct Investment and Portfolio Investment. Capital Account
is the net result of public and private international

Topicwise Solved PapersD12
investments flowing in and out of a country. Portfolio
investment is the buying of shares and bonds. FDI is the
investments by foreigners in a country or the citizens
investing in foreign countries.

79. (c) It is an activity by a central bank(RBI) to buy or sell
government securities. The aim of open market operations
is to manipulate the short term interest rate and the supply
of base money in an economy , and indirectly control the
total money supply .

80. (d) 12th Five Year Plan of the Government of India (2012-
17) aims at faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.

81. (a) Marginal Standing Facility rate is the rate at which banks
borrow funds overnight from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
against approved government securities. Net Demand and
time liability is the sum of demand and time liability of Banks
with public and other banks wherein assets with other banks
is subtracted to get net liability of other bank.

82. (b) Due to recession in 2008, the growth rate of the Indian
economy had declined for the next few years from 8-9% to
5-6%. Even though the growth rate had declined, it never
became negative. So, the GDP at market prices has always
increased year on year since last one decade

83. (c) Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the fee borne by
the merchant for using credit and debit card payment
system. To encourage digital transactions, Ministry of
Electronics and information technology (MEITY) had
announced that from 1 January 2018 for the next two years,
it'll bear the MDR fees of merchants, for payments up-to
Rs.2,000/- IF such payment is made via debit card, BHIM or
Aadhar enabled payment system.

84. (a)
• BHIM App was launched in 2016, it allows money
transfer to UPI-enabled bank accounts so #1 is right.
• The BHIM apps has three levels of authentication.
For one, the app binds with a device's ID and mobile
number, second a user needs to sync whichever bank
account (UPI or non-UPI enabled) in order to the conduct
transaction. Third, when a user sets up the app they are
asked to create a pin which is needed to log into the app.
Hence #2 is wrong.

85. (c) Till 2009, RBI's Institute for Development and Research
in Banking Technology (IDRBT) provided the linkages to
A TM network in India but afterwards, it was taken over by
NPCi's National Financial Switch (NFS).

86. (a) CAR is decided by the benchmarks set by BASEL-III
Committee on Banking supervision and implemented by the
central bank of individual country . So, #2 is right, whereas
#1 is correct.

87. (c) As per Economic Survey , first statement is right but
Central Government's domestic liability is ~46% so #2 is
wrong. By elimination, we get (C)

88. (c) When client books add in newspaper, he has to pay
18% GST to newspaper owner who deposits it to
Government. But when such newspaper is sold to public,
they are not required to pay newspaper price + GST. So #4
is exempted from GST. Processed / Canned food (#3) is
subject to GST. So, by elimination, we get correct answer C.
Some experts were divided that if eggs are cooked in a 5-
star hotel, it'll be subjected to GST however UPSC's official
Answer key has kept C is the correct option.

89. (d) This was introduced in 2016, as a separate legislation
under Finance Bill, and it doesn't provide tax credit in home
country so both wrong.
90. (d) Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) measures the percentage
increase in capital formation required obtaining a percentage
increase in GDP . Entrepreneurs, by investing their own
savings and informally mobilizing the savings of their friends
and relatives contribute to the process of capital formation.
These informal funding supplements the funds made
available by the formal means of raising resources from
banks, financial institutions and capital markets. So, "D" is
the fitting option- if capital to output ratio is high then capital
formation may not result in significant increase in the output.

91. (b) NCERT Macroeconomics Class12, page 40: observe
the table 
3.1: Deposits are plotted on the liability side of a
commercial bank’s balance sheet.

92. (b)
• Currency crisis usually denotes that Indian Rupee is
weakening and dollar is strengthening at a rapid level. In
ordinary circumstances, rupee dollar exchange rate is
determined by the market forces of supply and demand.
Therefore we have to encourage the inflow of dollars to
reduce the risk of currency crisis. #1 and #3 can help in
this regard, #2 is irrelevant. Infact #2 can backfire if raising
Government Expenditure results in excessive printing of
Rupee currency.
• Thus, by elimination answer is b: 1 and 
3.

93. (a) Bank Board Bureau (BBB) was setup in 2016, BBB
selects top officials (MD, CEO, Chairman and full-time
Directors) for PSBs, LIC and other public sector financial
institutions.

94. (b) PNGRB was constituted under The Petroleum and
Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 
2006.
SEBI was formed in 1988 by an executive order, given
statutory status in 
1992. Besides, IRDAI and many other
regulatory bodies were setup before 
2006. So, PNGRB is
certainly not the first body to be setup by Govt of India. #1
is wrong, by elimination we are left with answer b.

95. (a) As per RBI’s directive, payment system providers are
required to store the data in India only . Other features are
not required by RBI.

96. (a)
• NCERT class 12 Accountancy book also confirms,
“A higher Interest coverage ratio ensures safety of
interest on debts.”
• Third statement is wrong. Statement 1 is correct, By
looking at the interest coverage ratio we can identify the
present risk of a firm (That it is not generating good revenue).
There is only “A” option where statement#1 is present.

97. (c)
• Certificate of deposit is a short term debt
instrument. #2 is wrong since it says ‘long term
instrument’. This eliminates a and d.
• #3: Call money is a short term finance for interbank
transactions that is correct. So, Answer is (c).

98. (d)
• “Non-Financial debt” excludes the debt of Financial
Institutions i.e. those institutions that borrow solely to
re-lend and the money . [In other words if, NABARD,
ILFS etc had borrowed money to re-lend it, then it’d be
financial debt. And all other type of debt will be “non-
Financial debt”]
• So, In above options, all three loans are taken by
persons or entities who’ll not ‘re-lend’ it, but They will
use the funds for their own purpose. Therefore, Answer
should be “(d)”.

RBI will provide loans to the banking system which includes
commercial/cooperative banks, development banks etc.
when RBI lowers the bank rate, the cost of borrowing for
banks decreases and the credit volume gets increased
leading to increase in money and more liquidity in the market.

59. (b) DRDA has traditionally been the principal organ at the
district level to oversee the implementation of anti-poverty
programmes of the Ministry of Rural Development. It does
not acts as Panchayati Raj Institutions.

60. (a) Deprivation of education, health, assets and services
at household level

61. (a) The 13th finance commission has an elaborate design
for the GST. Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.
Report basically discusses the improved implementation of
the existing schemes. The third statement is correct. The
report in its para 
10.44 mentions: “Taking into account the
demand of local bodies that they be allowed to benefit from
the buoyancy of central taxes and the constitutional design
of supplementing the resources of Panchayats and
municipalities through grants-in-aid, we recommend that
local bodies be transferred a percentage of the divisible
pool of taxes cover and above the share of the states, as
stipulated by us, after converting this share to grant-in-aid
under Article 
275.”

63. (b) Capital gain is an increase in the value of a capital
asset (investment or real estate) that gives it a higher worth
than the purchase price. The gain is the difference between
a higher selling price and a lower purchase price. The
increase in the sales of a product does not mean increase
the selling price of the product.

64. (c) 
1. Purchase of government securities from the public
by the Central Bank

3. Borrowing by the government from the Central Bank

65. (d) A Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves
establishing a direct business interest in a foreign country ,
such as buying or establishing a manufacturing business,
while foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) refers to investing
in financial assets such as stocks or bords in a foreign
country. Hence, FDI does not involve portfolio Investment.

66. (b) The National Development Council includes the Prime
Minister, Union ministers, Chief ministers of all states,
administrative heads of the Union Territories and members
of the planning commission.

67. (a) To reap the benefits of demographic dividend, skills
have to be developed because a relatively larger portion of
population fall under the category of productive labour force
when there is a demographic dividend.

68. (d) General Price rise may be caused by an increase in the
money supply as the real value of the money reduces. The
higher aggregate price level will reduce the purchasing
power subsequently reducing the consumer spending.
Effective demand also increases when there is less
purchasing power due to inflation.

69. (d) Extremely high rates of inflation are generally
associated with high rates of money growth. It is often the
result of financing large deficits by printing money .

70. (c) Supply of money remaining the same when there is an
increase in demand for money, there will be an increase in
the rate of interest and vice-versa.

71. (c) A country’s economic growth is reflected through
capital formation, which in turn encourages private
enterprises in enhancing the growth of a country’s economy .

72. (c) When interest rates decreases then investment
expenditure by businesses on capital goods like factories
and equipment will increase in an economy.

73. (c) Non-plan expenditure covers interest payments,
subsidies (mainly on food and fertilisers), wage and salary
payments to government employees, grants to States and
Union Territories governments, pensions, police, economic
services in various sectors, defence, loans to public
enterprises, loans to States, Union Territories and foreign
governments.

74. (d) Taxes on tooth paste come under GST which is
administered by State government.Sales tax is paid to sales
tax authority in the state from where the goods are moved.

75. (b) Venture capital (VC) is a long term financial capital
provided to early-stage, high-potential, growth startup
companies or new companies.

76. (d) IOR-ARC is a regional cooperation initiative of the
Indian Ocean Rim countries which was established in
Mauritius in March 1997 with the aim of promoting
economic and technical cooperation. IOR-ARC is the onlypan-Indian ocean grouping. It brings together countries
from three continents having different sizes, economic
strengths, and a wide diversity of languages, cultures. It
aims to create a platform for trade, socio-economic and
cultural cooperation in the Indian Ocean rim area, which
constitutes a population of about two billion people.
Presently it has 19 members- Australia, Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Oman, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa,
Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, UAE and Y emen.
Six priority areas were identified to take forward the
cooperation under IOR-ARC:
(i) Maritime Safety and Security;
(ii) Trade and Investment Facilitation;
(iii) Fisheries Management;
(iv) Disaster Risk Reduction;
(v) Academic and S&T Cooperation; and
(vi) Tourism Promotion and Cultural Exchanges.

77. (c) When inflation becomes very high, the RBI decreases
supply of money (to check inflation) by adopting tight
monetary policy . Decreasing the money circulation
decreases the demand of goods and services, which helps
in controlling the inflation. It is mainly effective in case of
demand pull inflation.

78. (a) To reduce the budget deficit, the government has to
increase income and reduce Expenditure. Introducing new
welfare schemes and Expanding industries will increase the
government expenditure.

79. (a) The Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane is
approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

80. (c) Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is National
Mission for Financial Inclusion to ensure access to financial

unprecedented 42 per cent of the divisible pool to states
during 20015-16 to 2019-20, against 32 per cent suggested
by the previous commission.

82. (c) Convertibility of rupee implies freely permitting the
conversion of rupee to other currencies and vice versa.
Currency Convertibility is the ease with which a country's
currency can be converted into gold or another currency.

83. (d) The Government of India has established NITI Aayog
to replace the Planning Commission. The Union Government
of India announced formation of NITI Aayog on 1 January
2015 and the first meeting of NITI Aayog was held on 8
February 
2015.

84. (c) (i) Financial Stability and Development Council is an
apex-level body constituted by the government of India.
The idea to create such a super regulatory body was first
mooted by the Raghuram Rajan Committee in 
2008. Finally
in 2010, the then Finance Minister of India, Pranab
Mukherjee, decided to set up such an autonomous body
dealing with macro prudential and financial regularities in
the entire financial sector of India.

93. (c) NPCI is a not-for-profit company formed by various
banks, with primary objective of providing cost-effective
payment solutions to the banks. NPCI's solutions such as
IMPS, B H IM, R uPay , AEPS etc. hav e indeed helped in
financial inclusion. So first is correct. And second is
correct- NPCI launched Rupay card in 2012, as 7th
payment gateway in the world.

94. (a) "A" is the most appropriate choice. Mobile wallets
will not be necessary, because your mobile number is
directly linked with the bank account using bank's
'customized app' which is built on the UPI platform.

95. (a) MPC has 6 members, not 12; and it's headed by RBI
governor and not Finance Minister. So statement 2 and
3 are wrong, hence by elimination, we reach answer (A)
only 1 correct.

96. (a) While directly or indirectly all three will be encouraged
because of Small Finance banks. But when RBI invited
applications, the specific purpose were 1 and 2 only.

97. (c) NPS was compulsory for new central govt recruits
(except armed forces) WEF 1/1/
2004. so "D" is wrong.
A n y I n d i a n b e t w e e n 1 8 t o 5 5 c a n j o i n N P S . S o " B " i s
wrong. NRIs are allowed to open NPS account as per
PFRDA norms.
So we are left with answer "C".

98. (a) Exports will become ZERO RATED under GST, so
statements 2 and 3 would have been correct If examiner
had used moderate words "GST will help". But he has
used 'extreme' words. GST is unlikely to ' drastically ' reduce
CAD Because of crude oil import and OPEC cartel that
manipulates its prices. Similarly, GST is unlikely to
enormously increase size of oureconomy (IMF projection
~1-
1.5% addition in growth rate.) and we can't overtake
China in near future, because unlike China we are keeping
our currency undervalued against dollar. Hence statement
2 and 3 are wrong. We are left with Answer A.

99. (b) Act provides is an appellate tribunal, and they're
required to finish case within one y ear. So #3 is wrong,
by elimination, we are left with A and B. So, B is most
appropriate because IT dept (=therefore Government) can
seize the benami properties.

100. (d) If we look at the overall trend from 2007 to 2017
there is gradual increase but on yearly basis there have
been ups and downs. So, Neither Tax revenue nor Fiscal
deficit as a percentage of GDP have steadily increased.
UPSC kept D is the official answer

101. (b) Answer is "b" as per the Press Information Bureau.

102. (d) NIIF is under Department of Economic Affairs. So
first statement is wrong. It was setup in Budget 2015, with
Rs.40k crores, but even if counting the recent allotments
till Budget 2017, the 4 lakh amount is unrealistic. So,
second statement is also wrong.

103. (a) While this mission will certainly increase consumption
of millets, coarse cereals and eggs once people become
aware of their nutritional benefits, but promoting their
'consumption' is not the explicit objective of this mission.
Explicitly stated objectives are only 1 and 
2. So, experts
were divided between A and B and C- because in the
2016's UN-REDD+ question, UPSC official even kept
'indirect benefit' of poverty removal as one of the objective.
But in official answer key of 2017, they have gone only
by literal interpretation of explicitly mentioned 'direct
benefits, and they chose 'A' as the official answer.

104. (a)
• Indianexpress June 2016: HRD Ministry has launched
an initiative called 'Vidyanjali' to encourage youngsters to
volunteer their services at any neighborhood government
school. So accordingly "A" is the most appropriate choice.
• What about statement "3"? While the mygov.in portal
guidelines mention that Vidyanjali will cover initiatives
under CSR, PPP, PSU. But mobilization of voluntary
monetary contribution is not the primary and explicit
'purpose' of the scheme.
• And the scheme is targeted at primary (Class 1 to 5)
and upper primary classes (Class 6 to 8) so 'secondary
schools' infrastructure facilities' are beyond its scope of
work. HRD ministry's other schemes specifically count
class 9 onwards as 'secondary education'
Hence 3 is wrong. Therefore, Answer is "A".

105. (c)
•RBI is public debt manager for both state and union
Governments, so #1 is wrong.
• According to Dept of Economic Affairs, Short-term
debt of the Central Government on residual maturity basis
includes 14-day intermediate treasury bills, regular treasury
bills, dated securities maturing in the ensuing one year
and external debt with remaining maturity of less than one
year.
• Short-term debt of State Governments comprises
internal debt that includes market loans maturing within
next one year, and repayment of loans to Centre. Therefore,
#2 is right.
• T-bills are sold at discount and re-purchased at par
value (face value). So, #3 is right.

106. (c) From the finite money available, Government could
build a street light or a water tap. So, opportunity cost is
involved in pursuing either one of the activity. Experts
were divided over C or D-some interpreting thatopportunity cost is borne by the Decision Maker, while
others saying opportunity cost is borne by the person
w h o e v e n t u a l l y p a y s f o r i t . U P S C h a s k e p t ' C ' a s t h e
official answer.

107. (c) Economic development includes not only economic
growth but also various other economic changes that
improve the quality of life or standard of living of people
in a country. If with economic growth, a country
experiences various economic changes such as reduction
in poverty and unemployment, reduction in income and
wealth inequality, increase in literacy rate, improvement in
health and hygiene, etc, that improve the quality of life
then that is economic development. (NIOS Economics
Textbook Page 32). So, C is the fitting choice

108. (c) The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) is a flagship ini-
tiative of the Prime Minister, set up by NITI Aayog to pro-
mote innovation and entrepreneurship across the length
and breadth of the country .

109. (b) Page 19, Asian Development Bank document on
Understanding poverty in India.
• Poverty lines are estimated using the original state-
specific poverty lines identified by the Expert Group and
updating them to 2004–2005 prices using the Consumer
Price Index of Agricultural Laborers (CPIAL) for rural
poverty lines and Consumer Price Index for Industrial
Workers (CPIIW) for urban poverty lines.
• So, B: price levels is the most appropriate choice.

110. (a)
• 2nd FYP: rapid industrialization with particular
emphasis on the development of basic and heavy
industries so Statement1 is correct. This eliminates B and
C. The correct answer could be A or D. In both these
options, second statement is common so we should
accept statement #2 to be correct without checking its
validity.
• 5th FYP: Fifth Plan (1974-79) was formulated against
the backdrop of severe inflationary pressures. objectives
of the plan were to achieve self-reliance and adopt
measures for raising the consumption standard of people
living below the poverty line. This Plan also gave high
priority to bring inflation under control and to achieve
stability in the economic situation. It targeted an annual
growth rate of 
5.5 percent in the national income. There
is no mention of Financial Sector here, so #3 is wrong.
We are lef t with Answ er A: o nly 1 and 
2.

111. (c)As per the bare act:
• In case of a woman who has two or more children,
the maternity benefit will continue to be 12 weeks. If less
than two children then she’ll get 26 weeks paid leave.
• Every establishment with 50 or more employees to
provide crèche facilities within a prescribed distance. The
woman will be allowed four visits to the crèche in a day.
So #2 is wrong. We are left with Answer C: only 
3.

112. (a)
• PPP: Hypothetical concept that tries to compare two
currencies’ exchange rate through their purchasing power
in respective countries. So, #1 is right.

Topicwise Solved PapersD28
• 2014-April, Economic Times: India displaces Japan
to become third-largest world economy in terms of PPP:
World Bank. So #2 is wrong, we are left with answer A:
1 only.

113. (d) To control rupee weakening,
• A: will help by reducing the Current account deficit.
• B: will help by reducing the demand of dollars in
loan-repayment.
• C: will help by increasing the inflow of dollars and
other currencies.
• D: will backfire, because rupee currency supply will
increase without corresponding increase in the supply of
dollars and as a result: dollar will strengthen, Indian
Rupee will weaken further. So D is the answer.

114. (b)
• Money Multiplier directly improves with cut in legal
reserve ratios (SLR, CRR: so A and D are wrong)
• Money Multiplier indirectly improves as economy
develops, consumption/loan demand increases, banking
penetration improves etc.

115. (a)
• Keeping full capital account convertibility will make
India vulnerable to global crisis, just like the 1997’s crisis
among the East Asian countries. So number 3 is wrong.
• If Indian Government /RBI allows opening of more
foreign banks in India, there could be a dangerous
scenario where foreign problems may percolate into
Indian economy . So, #2 is wrong. So we are left with
Answer (a) only 
1.

116. (d)
• Aggregate money supply means M
3.
• = Coin and currency with public +Demand Deposit
with commercial banks +Time Deposits with commercial
banks
• So if you withdraw 100000 rupees from your
account then M3 will remain unchanged because ¹ 1 lakh
will shift from the column of “demand deposits” to the
“coin currency with public.”

117. (d) This document is presented as per the Provisions of
the FRBM act.

118. (b) Kisan Credit Card primarily meant for buying farm
inputs.So construction of ‘family house’ seems far-
fetched. So, #5 is wrong. Further, setting up a villagecold storage facility cannot be done through a short-term
credit (as given in the question premise) it will require a
very long term loan. So, #5 is wrong. By elimination we
are left with answer “b”.
Interestingly no questions from the government schemes
related to insurance and pension. Although in the last
two years many initiatives were undertaken such as PM
Shram Yogi Maan Dhan, Laghu V yapari Maan Dhan,
Kisan Maan Dhan etc. schemes

119. (a)
• Under the new monetary policy Framework effective
since 2016, RBI tries to control inflation at 2-6% of CPI
(All India). So, #3 is wrong. Option c and d eliminated. In
both (a & b) the options, statement#2 is common so we
have to accept #2 as correct, Even without checking.
Everything boils down to whether statement#1 is correct
or not?
• Both WPI and CPI are based on Laspeyres formula
wherein weightage is assigned to multiple commodities
and their prices are tracked. The weight of an individual
commodity depends on how frequently it is bought by
the consumer. So obviously consumer price index would
be giving more weightage to the food products compared
to WPI which is aimed at the manufacturers. So, #1
should be correct.

120. (b)
• After the LPG reforms of 1991 it is inevitable that
the rural/agriculture workforce would start shifting
towards urban/non-agri sectors. So that means #2 is
wrong and #3 should be correct.
• Since the total number of workers have remained
more or less the same but # of rural workers declined,
That means their Percentage share also declined, And it
will also hint that growth rate in Rural Employment has
decreased. so Statement#2 is wrong while #4 is correct.
Only option b fits into this pattern.

121. (b) If you make the word Association that cyber
insurance means something that arises out of this
internet related cyber security challenge then the second
statement is difficult to digest, that if your personal
enemy / neighbour’s kid / ex-husband/wife physical
damages your computer.’ Insurance firm will pay the
cover for that. So, #2 is wrong. By elimination the answer
should be “B”.

Topicwise Solved PapersD32

1. (d) Art. 269 says taxes on income other than agricultural
income shall be levied and collected by the Government of
India and distributed between the Union and States. Entry
46 in the state list of Seventh Schedule. This gives power to
the state governments to impose agricultural income tax.

2. (a) Rice production is highest in India among cereals but
its quality of rice cannot compete with other rice producing
countries. Most of rice produced in India is meant for
internal consumption. India is a major producer and
exporter of Basmati rice.

3. (d) Prevailing illiteracy in rural areas does not lower
productivity. The farmer has adequate knowledge of
farming techniques. Low prices of primary products
compared to the manufactured products and investment in
the agriculture sector compared to the industry are major
factors which accounts for low incomes in rural economy
than in Urban economy .

4. (b) Iron ore is exported to Japan. Leather goods are
exported to Russia. Tea is exported to U.K. Cotton fabric is
exported to U.S.A.

5. (a) The most appropriate answer is (a). Investment,
weather conditions and agricultural transformation are the
best indicators of agricultural development. Political stability
plays a very small role in agricultural development.

6. (c) The terminator gene is a specific genetic sequence
inserted into a seed’s DNA. Once activated by a synthetic
chemical catalyst of the manufacturer’s choosing, the
sequence renders the seed and crop it produces sterile.
This means that the farmer cannot retain seeds for future
crops as is the practice in India. The farmer has to
repurchase the seeds at a heavy cost.

7. (b) The decreasing order of the sugarcane producing
States in India is:
Uttar Pradesh- 
132427.6842, Maharashtra-
69648.0768,
Karnataka-35732, Tamil Nadu-
33919.17, Andhra Pradesh-
15567 (2012-13 Data).

8. (c) Maharashtra has the highest acreage under Jawar in
India. Now , Gujarat is the largest producer of Groundnut in
India with a share of more than 50%. Rajasthan has the
largest area of cultivable wastelands in India of around
84,929 sq. km. Andhra Pradesh has the highest per hectare
yield of maize in India followed by Tamil Nadu due to
majority of the area being covered under Single Cross
Hybrids (SCH.)

9. (d) In the given bar diagram the annual production of
“Rice” for the period 1991–92 to 1998–99 is shown.
Y ear

10. (b) Largest agricultural exports were of marine products
followed by tea and spices.
11. (c) Regarding the procurement of food-grains,
Government of India follows a procurement target rather
than an open-ended procurement policy. In case, there is
no procurement target. The government allows the
procurement agencies like the FCI to buy whatever is
offered by the farmers for sale at MSP. Minimum Support
Price is announced for around 22 crops. Wheat and Rice are
issued by the central Government at Uniform central issue
Prices (CIPs) to states and Union Territories for distribution
under TPDS. The difference between the economic cost
and issue price of food grains is reimbursed to the FCI by
the central Government in the form of subsidy .

12. (b) The reduction of rainfall and leak of seed preservation
technology are the main cause.

13. (d) The National Development Council (NDC) in its 53rd
meeting held on 29th May, 2007 adopted a resolution to
launch a Food Security Mission consisting of rice, wheat
and pulses and to increase the production of rice by 10
million tons, wheat by 8 million tons and pulses by 2 million
tons by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2011–12). The project
is under Ministry of Agriculture. The project identifies
districts and varieties which would be concentrated on.

14. (c) Statutory minimum price of sugarcane for every
season is a policy provision while sugar and sugarcane
falls within essential commodities act.

15. (c) The first statement is correct because with Micro
irrigation, Fertigation can be used to check the loss of the
nutrients. The second statement is incorrect. The third
statement is correct, because Micro irrigation has evolved
from the sub-irrigation where irrigation water is supplied to
the plant by “raising the water table” up to the root zone.

16. (c) Seabuckthorn is a medicinal plant which has health-
promoting properties. It can play a crucial role in
preventing soil erosion and help nitrogen fix option in cold
and desert areas.

17. (b) We have a National Seed policy made in 
2002. So 1 is not
a constraint. The private sector produces high-priced seeds
but in lower volume. It supplies nearly the entire hybrid seeds
required for vegetables. So 2 is not a constraint. In the case of
low value and high volume crops such as wheat and rice,
farmers tend to use their own preserved seeds as there is
demand and supply gap. So 3 is a constraint.

18. (c) As per Tamilnadu Agriculture University:
Advantages of drip irrigation system: Water saving and
higher yield, High quality and increased fruit size, Suitable
for all types of soil, Easy method of fertigation and
chemigation, saving in labour, reduces weed formation and
soil erosion. Whereas Disadvantage of drip irrigation
system: High initial investment, Clogging of emitters,
Possible damage of system components due to animals,
etc. After the exam, experts were divided between A and C
since both soil salinity and soil erosion are reduced
depending on various books. But in its official Answer key,
UPSC has kept "C" as the answer.

19. (b) (i) Spraying urea with Neem oil slows the release of
nitrogen, by about 10 to 15 per cent, concomitantly reducing
consumption of the fertiliser. Many research studies in India
have conclusively established that Neem oil acts as an
effective nitrification inhibitor if coated onto urea.HINTS & SOLUTIONS


Agriculture in the National Economy D33
(ii) Spraying urea with neem oil slows the release of
nitrogen, by about 10 to 15 per cent, concomitantly
reducing consumption of the fertiliser. Hence B is the
closest answer.

20. (b) (i) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will also seek to
address a long standing demand of farmers and provide
farm level assessment for localised calamities including
hailstorms, unseasonal rains, landslides and inundation.
(ii) Post-harvest loss is included so #2 is right. But Under
the new scheme, farmers will have to pay a uniform premium
of two per cent for all kharif crops and 
1.5 per cent for all rabi
crops. For annual commercial and horticultural crops,
farmers will have to pay a premium of 5 per cent. So, #1 is
wrong. Therefore, answer (b) only 
2.

21. (b) From the statistical appendix given in the economic
survey 2015-16 the answer is "B". While it's possible that in
some years, FDI and world share in exports would have
declined than previous years because of global financial
crisis, but by and large compared to Pre-LPG and Post-LPG ,
there is definitely an increase.

22. (a) First is correct as per BIS website.And AGMARK is
issued under Indian Act. Besides, it's an 'extreme
statement', FAO would not bother with small things.

23. (a) Encyclopedia Britannica: In the 15th and 16th
centuries, during the Columbian Exchange: numerous
plants, animals, and microbes from old world (Europe,
Asia, and Africa) were introduced to the new world
(Americas) and vice versa. From the image given in the
link, it’s evident that Cocoa and Tobacco were introduced
from new world to old world so only A fits.

24. (c)
• National IPR Policy 2016 shifted the Copyright Office
and its statutory body Intellectual Property Appellate
Board (IPAB) from HRD ministry to commerce ministry.
• India Patent Act: Chapter 2: Inventions not
patentable: Bullet (j): plants and animals in whole or any
part thereof, including seeds, varieties and species. So,
#1 is wrong, #3 is right, answer is (c).

25. (d)
• Majority of the external debt is by the private sector’s
external commercial borrowing (ECB). So #1 is wrong.
• Second statement is extreme worded hyperbole so
it’s wrong. But just to crosscheck: Page 154 of 154
Economic Survey 2016-17: US dollar denominated debt
accounted for 
55.6 per cent of India’s total external debt
at end- September 2016, followed by Indian rupee (
30.1
per cent), SDR (
5.8 per cent), Japanese Yen (
4.8 per cent)
Pound Sterling (
0.7 per cent), Euro (
2.4 per cent) and
others (
0.6 per cent).

26. (c) Page 117, Economic Survey 2017-18 Volume 2
• Economic Cost of foodgrains consists of three
components: Pooled cost of grains, which is the weighted
M S P o f t h e s t o c k o f f o o d g r a i n s a v a i l a b l e w i t h F C I ,
procurement incidentals, cost of distribution
• Thus answer is (c).
27. (b)
•#2 is right as per NCERT Class12 Chemistry.
•2019: Government replied in Rajya Sabha, “As far as
market-linking of urea prices is concerned, the MRP of
urea is statutorily fixed by the Government. Whereas,
MRP of Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers the
manufacturers/marketers are allowed to fix the MRP at
reasonable rates as per market dynamics.” Therefore first
statement is not fully correct. (REF: PIB) So #1 is wrong.
•Indian Bureau of mines booklet: The sulphur is
obtained as a by-product from oil refineries. Most of the
sulphur is converted to sulphuric acid (H2SO4) which is
used in the manufacture of phosphatic fertilizer. So #3
should be correct. Hence the answer is “b”.

28. (a)
•India produces a variety of pulses so it is difficult to
believe that green gram alone accounts for nearly 50% of
production. #2 should be wrong, And by elimination the
a n s w e r s h o u l d b e “ A ” . B u t j u s t t o b e s u r e l e t ’ s c r o s s
check with the data
•Looking at the PIB production data of 2016, 2017
and 2018: Gram (Chanaa) and Tur production seem to be
higher than Green gram (Moong), so, #2 is wrong. So, b,
c and d were eliminated.
•F u rt h e r i n t he s am e d at a s e t w e c a n al s o s e e th a t
There is no clear cut increase or decrease as described in
the statement 
3. So #3 is wrong. And, Black gram (urad)
Production detail for both Rabi and kharif seasons are
given so #1 is right.

29. (c)
•Investment is a term associated with the capital part
of the budget. So “subsidy”-a revenue part is not an
example of ‘public investment’. Economic Survey 2019-20
page 84 also confirms this.
•Free electricity to farmers involves the government
paying subsidy to the electricity company. Therefore #4
is wrong. Setting up of cold storage facilities can help in
preservation of the perishable agricultural commodities
so #6 is valid. So, answer should be “c”.

30. (d)
•Successive Economic surveys have highlighted that
Government’s open ended procurement is limited to
wheat and rice.
•And even after PM-AASHA reforms, procurement is
not done for all the cereals for which MSP is announced
(e.g. Jowar, Bajra, Ragi etc). So, #1 is wrong.
•Market factors of Supply and demand may create a
scenario where market price of cereal/pulses may rise higher
than MSP . Market players are not legally bound to keep
their prices lower or higher than MSP. So, #2 is wrong.

31. (b)
•Compared to DCCB, scheduled commercial banks
command larger quantities of deposits, more number of
Bank branches, have an obligation to give 18% of their
loans to agriculture under the priority sector lending
(PSL). Therefore statement#1 is unpalatable ( gte djuk
eqf'dy gS ) and wrong.
•Statement#2 is correct. DCCBs give funds
downwards to PACS.

Labels have to contains 1, 2 and 4 that much is confirmed.
And since UPSC has not given any option on “All correct”.
Hence answer (c).

48. (c) Both statements are correct, as per their organization's
about us page.

49. (d) GI indicators fall under WTO domain so D is the
answer.

50. (c) 1,3,4 and 5
Mrunal's Lecture BoP#3: at 24th minute
· RCEP about ASEAN plus its free trade partners which
includes: China, India, Japan, Korea, Australia and
NewZealan(d)
· Canada (#2) and USA (#6) is definitely not there, so
A, B and D are remove(d) Thus by elimination, we are left
with answer (C)

51. (a) First statement is right as per ICAR report. If we look
at the budget documents of last three year, Government
does impose custom duty on imported edible oils, so, #2
is a hyperbole wrong statement.
52. (a)
· 1973: Coal Mines Nationalization Act- Coal India and
other CPSEs took over private coal mining companies. They
will dig coal, sell it to thermal power plants & other
industries. (Indira Gandhi was PM at that time.) So, #1 is
right. Answer could be A or D.
· 2015: Coal Mines Special Provision Act: It opens up
commercial coal mining for both private and public entities,
and thus ends the monopoly of Coal India. Presently , coal
blocks are allotted on the basis of auction. #2 is wrong.
Thus Answer A: 1 only .

53. (b)
• FDI is more than 10% equity investment by a
foreign entity into an Indian company .
• That means debt / borrowing / loans are not the
words we associate with FDI and therefore option c and
d are wrong.
• Walmart has invested billions of dollars worth FDI
into Flipkart which is still an unlisted company (Unlisted
company means its shares are not listed in stock
exchange such as BSE NSE.)Therefore, A, is also wrong.
So, Answer should be b.

54. (d)
• Continuously, we are suffering from current account
deficits so for statement#4 is correct. Option a and c are
eliminated since they don’t contain #
4.
• Further India’s Merchandise/ goods export is less
than its goods imports. So, #1 is correct. Hence the
answer should be d.
• For further datasets, you may refer to Economic
Survey 2019-20 Volume 2: page 
104.

55. (c) As per the official page of WTO: The Agreement is
not concerned with the regulation of foreign investment.
So, #3 is right. The coverage of the Agreement is defined
in Article 1, which states that the Agreement applies to
investment measures related to trade in goods only .
Meaning, the TRIMs Agreement does not apply to
services. So, #2 is wrong. So, Answer should be c.

industrial activity , sale/purchase/construction of immovable
property . They cannot accept demand deposits like
commercial banks as they are not a part of clearance and
settlement system.

27. (a) Bear is a speculator who sells shares in anticipation of
fall operator prices to buy them back and thus make a profit.

28. (d) It is fixed by Reserve Bank of India. In 2011, RBI
permitted the commercial banks to fix interest rate on saving
account independently.

29. (c) The Banking ombudsman Scheme is an expeditious and
inexpensive forum for bank customers for resolution of
complaints relating to certain services rendered by banks.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Banking
Ombudsman can approach the Appellate Authority. The
Appellate Authority is vested with a Deputy Governor of the
RBI.

30. (d) “Financial inclusion” is the delivery of financial services
at affordable costs to vast sections of disadvantaged and
low income groups. Banking services are in the nature of
public good. It is essential that availability of banking and
payment services be available to the entire population
without discrimination.

with capital investment and advisory services. IDA was
created in 
1960.

33. (c) The basic aim of Lead Bank scheme is that the bank
should adopt particular districts for intensive development
by offering loans and banking services.

34. (d) The Reserve Bank of India is the main monetary
authority of the country and beside that, in its capacity as
the central bank, acts as the bank of the national and state
governments.
35. (d) A tight monetary policy is a course of action
undertaken by Central bank to constrict spending in an
economy , or to curb inflation when it is rising too fast. The
increased bank rate increases the cost of borrowing and
effectively reduces its attractiveness.

36. (c) Land development bank started financing long term
loan for more significant rural development activities like
rural and cottage industries, rural artisans etc. The main
purpose of RRB’s is to mobilize financial resources from
rural / semi-urban areas and grant loans and advances mostly
to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers and
rural artisans. NABARD doesnot give “direct” credit
assistance. It provides credit Via intermediaries such as
Microfinance companies, Cooperative society, RRB.

37. (a) Those who benefit from higher inflation are debtors
a nd t h o s e w h o s u f f e r f ro m i t a re c re d it o r s . I f o n e ha s
substantial debt, each rupee one has to repay would be
worth less than when it was borrowed. In this way , one
pays back less in real terms.

38. (d) Currency/cash is the most liquid, then the demand
deposits (current accounts), then the saving deposits with
bank and finally the least liquid is the time deposits with the
bank (fixed deposits).

39. (c) Besides giving access to banking, it also enables
government subsidies and social security benefits to be
directly credited to the accounts of the beneficiaries,
enabling them to draw the money from the bank saathi or
business correspondents in their village itself.

40. (a) 1 is definitely correct as CRR. SLR is used to control
mo ney supply and credit o f f take. 2 may o r may no t b e
correct, to make people's deposit safe, capital adequacy
ratio is the norm. 3 is definitely wrong as to control excess
profit, margins would have to be reduced, not CRR, SLR.

41. (b) Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures
which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision and to strengthen the regulation, supervision
and risk m anagement of the banking sector. These measures
aim to:
Improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks
arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the
source; improve risk management and governance;
strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures.

42. (c) The RBI implements the monetary policy through open
market operations, bank rate policy , reserve system, credit
control policy , moral persuasion and through many other
instruments.

43. (c) When the Reserve Bank of India reduces the Statutory
Liquidity Ratio by 50 basis points; the Scheduled
Commercial Banks may cut their lending rates.

44. (c) (i) With effect from 1st April, 2016, all loans in India
shall be priced with reference to Marginal Cost of Funds
based Lending Rates (MCLR) which will comprise of :- 
1.
Marginal Cost of Funds 
2. Negative carry on account of
CRR 
3. Operating Costs 
4. Tenor of premium. Banks shall
review and publish their MCLR every month on a pre-
announced date. Marginal Cost of Funds which will
comprise of marginal cost of borrowings and return on net-
worth.

45. (b) (i) They can enable transfers and remittance through
mobile phones. The RBI guidelines say that the payments
bank cannot undertake lending activities.
(ii) Mobile phone companies and supermarket eligible.
But, Payment banks can’t issue credit card or give loans.
Go by eliminating all options with “2”, and you’re left with
(b) 1 and 3 only.

46. (a) (i) Core Banking Solution (CBS) is networking of
branches, which enables Customers to operate their
accounts, and avail banking services from any branch of
the Bank on CBS network, regardless of where he maintains
his account. The customer is no more the customer of a
Branch. He becomes the Bank’s Customer. Thus CBS is a
step towards enhancing customer convenience through
Anywhere and Anytime Banking.
(ii) 3 is definitely not the purpose, so by elimination the
answer is (a).

47. (b) (i) Bitcoin are not maintained by the Central Bank.
Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing
work in which users offer their computing power to verify
and record payments into a public ledger.
(ii) They’re not tracked by any central bank or authority .
Both 2 and 3 are right.

48. (b) (i) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is a tax
avoidance strategy used by multinational companies,
wherein profits are shifted from jurisdictions that have high
taxes (such as the United States and many Western
European countries) to jurisdictions that have low (or no)
taxes (so-called tax havens). The BEPS project is said to be
an “attempt by the world’s major economies to try to rewrite
the rules on corporate taxation to address the widespread
perception that the [corporations] don’t pay their fair share
of taxes”.
(ii) BEPS aims to curb the tax evasion by MNCs, hence B
is the answer.

49. (c) (i) In order to reduce the fiscal deficit, the government
needs to increase its earnings and reduce its expenditure.
This is done by following methods: Cut down the
subsidies; reforms in tax structures; improve profit
generated by Public Sector Enterprises and austerity
measures.

1. (d) When a parachutist jumps from a height, its speed
first increases with the distance fallen and then becomes
constant. So, the graph given in option (d) best represents
the given situation.

2. (d) Brahmagupta was an Indian mathematician and
astronomer who had written numerous important books on
mathematics and astronomy . He anticipated Newton by
declaring that all things gravitate to the earth.

3. (a) If a fluid flows such that its velocity at a point is always
the same in magnitude and direction, the fluid is said to
have a streamline flow. The type of flow in a fluid system is
characterized by the presence of laminae, or parallel streams
of fluid. A streamline is a straight or curved path such that
tangent to it at a point gives the direction of flow of liquid at
that point. Thus, according to question the flow profile is
best represented by figure (a).

5. (b) A simple machine is a mechanical device that changes
the direction or magnitude of a force. In general, they can
be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical
advantage to multiply force. Thus, simple machine helps us

examples of simple machines are pulley, lever ,wheel, screw,
etc.

6. (a) It is observed that liquid drop tend to contract and
appear spherical when it is set free from external forces like
gravity , etc. Surface tension is the property among liquids
due to which they tend to occupy minimum surface area.
That's why water droplet appears spherical because for a
given volume, a sphere has minimum surface area. Due to
this property of surface tension liquid surface stretches
and behaves like a stretched membrane.

7. (a) Scalars are quantities that have magnitude only; they
are independent of direction. V ectors have both magnitude
and direction. Momentum is the product of the mass and
velocity of an object ( p = mv). Momentum is a vector
quantity , since it has a direction as well as a magnitude. The
rest of quantities in option pressure, work and energy have
magnitude but not direction.

8. (a) Effective length is the length of point of suspension
to the centre of gravity(mass) of a body. Let it be l when the
girl is sitting and l' when girl stands up. Here l > l'. Thus,
the time period of swing will decrease because time period
of swing is given by formulalT = 2πg
So, it is clear from above formula that the time period of
system is directly proportional to effective length.

9. (d) The above diagram represents a body in projectile
motion
Maximum height ymax = nq22sin
2g
Thus, according to above equation greater the initial
inclination, the greater is the height reached.

10. (a) Washing machine works on the principle of
centrifugation. Centrifugation is a process that involves
the use of the centrifugal force for the separation of mixtures
with a centrifuge, used in industry and in laboratory settings.
More-dense components of the mixture migrate away from
the axis of the centrifuge, while less-dense components of
the mixture migrate towards the axis.

11. (c) An object on an inclined plane with inclination q moves

13. (a) As monkey and bullet both fall under the same
gravitational force, so bullet will hit exactly the same point it

14. (b) Capillary action, or capillarity, is a phenomenon where
liquid spontaneously rises in a narrow space such as a thin
tube, or in porous materials such as paper or in some non-
porous materials such as liquified carbon fibre. This effect
can cause liquids to flow against the force of gravity or the
magnetic field induction. In blotting of ink, spread of water

15. (b) A "streamlined" design is one in which objects that
move through a gas or liquid are shaped to match these
lines, and therefore, reduce the energy required to produce
that motion. Multi point fuel injection system injects fuel
into individual cylinders, based on commands from the 'on
board engine management system computer—popularly
known as the Engine Control Unit/ECU. These techniques
result not only in better 'power balance' amongst the
cylinders but also in higher output from each one of them,
along with faster throttle response. The other two options
radial tyres and catalytic converter with exhaust do not
contribute to make the car more fuel efficient.

16. (b) First statement can be explained on the basis of laws
of motion. First statement involves the use of Newton's
third law of motion, "For every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction". In first case while whistling a man uses
his breathe as a propellant to propel himself. The second
statement can be explained on the basis of law of
conservation of linear momentum according to which the
momentum of body remains conserved until any external
force acts upon it.

17. (c) Mass is a universal constant. The mass of a body
re mains u nc hang e d in any p art o f u niv e rs e . M as s o f a
body does not change with respect to gravity . It is the weight
that changes with gravity .

18. (c) The bob of a simple pendulum is attached to a string
which pulls the bob along its length.
B B¢
AC C¢
Here B and C are extreme positions whereas A is mean
position.The speed of the bob increases as it approaches
the mean position A and continues to move till it reaches C.
At C the speed becomes zero. Due to the unbalanced force
the bob moves towards the mean position. The speed of
the bob is maximum at the mean position and is zero at the
extreme positions. Thus, it is clear that in each cycle bob
velocity increases from zero to maximum. This means that it
attains a given velocity twice. Suppose the bob of the
pendulum reaches up to B while oscillating, then AB is the
amplitude. For the next oscillation the bob fails to reach B
but it will reverse the direction from point B¢ instead of B.
The amplitude of oscillation in the second case is AB¢ which
is less than AB. That means, a retarding force is acting on
the bob thereby reducing the amplitude of oscillation. This
retarding force is nothing but air-resistance or air-friction.
At extreme position, acceleration is maximum. So statement
3 is not correct.
19. (d) Figure (d) correctly represents the time-distance graph
for one dimensional uniform motion.

20. (d) Statement 1 is false. The temperature dependence of
liquid viscosity is the phenomenon by which liquid viscosity
tends to decrease (or, alternatively , its fluidity tends to
increase) as its temperature increases. Thus, with increase
of temperature viscosity of glycerine decrease. Statement 2
is correct because with the rise of temperature in case of
liquid, the kinetic energy increases as kinetic energy of liquid
molecules is directly proportional to absolute temperature.

21. (c) Statement 1 is true but statement 2 is false. Specific
gravity is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of
a substance to the density (mass of the same unit volume)
of a reference substance. Mercury has a specific gravity of

13.56 whereas specific gravity of iron is 
7.
21.Thus, iron ball
floats on mercury.

22. (b) The volume of 2 cm part of the cube, assuming
the side of cube is x.
Volume = 2 × x × x = 2x2
Mass displaced by this portion = 
0.2 kg = 200 gm
Using
Mass = V olume × density x2 cm
200 = 2x2 × 1
x2 = 100
x = 10 cm

23. (b) Weight is basically the measurement of the
gravitational force that acts on an object. Weight of any
body is given by formula
 W = mg,
Where m is the mass of body.
g refers to the acceleration that the Earth imparts to objects
on or near its surface. It is called acceleration due to gravity .
Now, mass is universal constant. It will remain same at earth
surface or at any point above the surface of earth.
Acceleration due to gravity decreases with altitude, since
greater altitude means greater distance from the Earth's
centre.
The following formula approximates the Earth's gravity
formula variation with altitude: 2
ro
ereggrhæö= ç÷ç÷+èø
Where
gr is the gravity measure at height above sea level.
re is the Earth's mean radius.
go is the standard gravity .
Earth is not a perfect sphere because its two poles cause it
to bulge out in the middle. It spins on its axis and the
centrifugal force makes the part at the equator bulge out
slightly.


Physics E11

24. (a) In case of object moving along a circular path two
types of forces centripetal and centrifugal acts upon it. As
they have opposite impact thus, the object remains in
balance. When centrifugal force gets disturbed then the
object will leave the balance and skid toward an outward
direction.

25. (c) The surface of tanker will move in forward direction
with increasing velocity (as acceleration in uniform), so depth
will be larger at the rear end.

26. (b) The value of g on earth's surface is given by
=2GMg
R
ÞD æ Dö=- ç÷èø2g R
gR (if M is constant)
Thus, if radius of the earth shrinks by 1%, the value of g will
increase by 2%.

27. (d) By Newton's second law F = ma. If a = 0, Fnet = 0
Thus, the resultant force is zero.

28. (b) A body moving with a uniform angular velocity w on a
circular path of radius r has radial acceleration equal w2r
directed towards the centre of the path.

29. (d) In this case, balloon is filled up with water and then
put into water. Initially , after some oscillations it become
stable because the downward directing force exerted by
weight of water in balloon is balanced by the upward
directing buoyancy force of water. Hence, the resultant
weight in water is zero as there is no resultant force acting
upon it.

30. (b) Density of gold is 
19.30 g/cm
3. The density of ultra
pure liquid mercury is 
13.534 g/cm3 and the density of steel
is 
7.80 g/cm

31. (b) Earth's mean orbital speed is 30 km/s.

32. (c) Elongation ( Dl) in a wire is given by
=´DFlYAl
Þ D=FllAY
For wires of same material and same load,
Dµ Þ Dµ2llllA r
Therefore, the extensions will be maximum in case of the
wire with length 3 m and diameter 
1.5 mm.

33. (d) Viscocity of Kerosene is least among all, so it will
emptied first.

34. (b)

1. it would be difficult to use a kerosene lamp

2. the blotting paper would fail to function

3. the big trees that we see around would not have grown
on the Earth

35. (c) Ball bearings are used to reduce friction and friction is
directly proportional to effective surface area. So if
effective surface area is reduced then friction will also
reduce.B. Heat and Thermodynamics

36. (d) Because of density. The density of the clouds is less
than that of the air.

37. (b) Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change
in volume in response to a change in temperature. In this
case A expands more than B. Therefore, expansion of volume
will be more for A in comparison to B on application of same
amount of heat. Therefore, on heating it will appear like
figure (b).

38. (a) In physics, cryogenics is the study of the production
of very low temperature (below –150 °C, – 238 °F or 123 K)
and the behavior of materials at those temperatures.
Application of cryogenics are in MRI.
MRI is a method of imaging objects that uses a strong
magnetic field to detect the relaxation of protons that have
been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse. This magnetic
field is generated by electromagnets, and high field strengths
can be achieved by using superconducting magnets.
Traditionally , liquid helium is used to cool the coils because
it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure.
Cryogenic liquids are also used in the space program. For
example, cryogens are used to propel rockets into space. A
tank of liquid hydrogen provides the fuel to be burned and
a second tank of liquid oxygen is provided for combustion.
Cryogenic processes are also used to supply "banks"
storing eye corneas, blood, and sperm for future surgical
procedures. In 1961 American surgeon Irving S. Cooper
introduced a freezing technique called cryosurgery.
Cryosurgery is relatively bloodless because the low
temperatures used constrict the blood vessels, stemming
the loss of blood.

39. (b) Both statement 1 and statement 2 are correct. On
heating up to same temperature copper piece is found hotter
than in comparison to glass piece because copper being a
metal is a good conductor of heat and electricity while glass
on the other hand is a poor conductor of heat. The density
of copper is 
8.92 gm/cm3 and of glass is 
2.6 gm/cm3 .

40. (c) The boiling point of an element or a substance is the
temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid equals
the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid. As
altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, so
boiling point decreases, so the liquid would boil at a lower
temperature.

41. (d) Initially at start of heating from 0°C to 4°C there will be
a contraction as a result of which volume decreases. On
further heating beyond 4°C to 10°C the molecules gain
kinetic energy and start moving more randomly . Thus,
intermolecular distance increases as a result of which its
volume increases.

42. (c) The loss of heat is directly proportional to the surface
area, hence loss of heat will be earlier in case of sphere
because it has the maximum surface area.

43. (d) Only statement 3 is correct. An air conditioner (often
referred to as AC) is a home appliance, system, or mechanism
designed to dehumidify and extract heat from an area. Steam
(at 100 degree Celsius ) has more energy than water

Topicwise Solved PapersE12
( at 100 degree Celsius ) because it takes energy to break the
bonds that keep it liquid. Latent heat is the heat released or
absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic
system during a change of state that occurs without a
change in temperature. Latent heat of fusion of water is 334
kJ/kg whereas Latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260
kJ/kg.

44. (b) Cloudy nights are warmer than clear nights because,
the cloud cover provides a shield which act as an insulator
and store up the heat radiated by the earth and do not
permit heat to escape.

45. (c) The anomalous expension of water as it cools from
4°C to 0°C means that the density of water is greatest at
4°C. So the ice that forms in cold weather forms at the top of
the water (where the less dense coldest water gathers) and
then acts as an insulating barrier preventing the water
underneath from getting much colder (because heat cannot
escape).
C. Optics and Sound

46. (c) Sounds may be generally characterized by pitch,
loudness, and quality . Sound "quality" or "timbre" describes
those characteristics of sound which allow the ear to
distinguish sounds which have the same pitch and loudness.
Quality is then a general term for the distinguishable
characteristics of a tone.

47. (c) This is a phenomenon of total internal reflection of
light, dependent on the`critical angle' of the incidence of
light in a material medium at its bounding surface with air.
The higher the refractive index of a transparent material the
smaller is the critical angle and hence the larger is the range
of angles of incidence for more light to be totally reflected.
A diamond has a large refractive index and very small critical
angle as against glass, which has a lower refractive index
and large critical angle.
A skilled diamond cutter exploits the large range of angles
of incidence in the diamond to cut multiple faces at suitable
angles. Light entering diamond from different faces, suffers
multiple total internal reflection and comes out of the
diamond as intense beams from selected directions. Hence,
a diamond shines brilliantly .

48. (a) An optical fibre is a thin, flexible, transparent fibre that
acts as a waveguide or "light pipe" to transmit light between
the two ends of the fibre. An optical fibre transmits light
along its axis, by the process of total internal reflection.
When light traveling in a dense medium hits a boundary at
an angle larger than the "critical angle" for the boundary ,
the light will be completely reflected. This effect is used in
optical fibres to confine light in the core.

49. (d) The observer on the earth will detect a wavelength
given by
0λ–λ
λvc=±
where l = original wavelength
l0 = apparent wavelength
v = velocity of source
Here, source is receding, therefore +ve sign will be takenQ 0λ–λ 2c10 λc= 00 22110 10l-llÞ = Þ -=ll
0
002 8 101 
1.251 0 1 08lÞ=-= Þ l = l =ll
The wavelength of blue light varies from 450 nm to
475 nm. Therefore, the observed light will have wavelength
ranging from 
562.5 nm to 
593.75 nm which will be yellow orange.

50. (d) Air bubble in water would act as a diverging lens,
because the index of refraction of air is less than that of
water.

51. (d) Consider a plane-mirror and a fixed incident ray of light.
Before the mirror has rotated, the angle of incidence is q as
is the angle of reflection. If the mirror is rotated through an
angle f the normal is rotated by an angle f and thus the
angle of incidence increases to q + f. Therefore, the angle of
reflection must also increase by f to q + f. The difference
between the final angle of reflection and the initial angle of
reflection is 2 f. Thus for a fixed incident ray, the angle of the
reflection is twice the angle through which the mirror has rotated.

52. (a) Total internal reflection is an optical phenomenon that
happens when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at
an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect
to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower
on the other side of the boundary , no light can pass through
and all light is reflected. The critical angle is the angle of
incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.
Total internal reflection takes place when light travels from
optically denser medium to optically rarer medium.
Refractive index of diamond is very high (
2.417) whereas
refractive index of glass is only in between (
1.5 to 
1.6),
whereas in rest all options there is no possibility of total
internal reflection because refractive index of water (
1.33)
and air (
1.0008) is less than refractive index of glass.

53. (c) Mach number (Ma or M) is the speed of an object
moving through air, or any other fluid substance. It is
commonly used to represent the speed of an object when it
is travelling close to or above the speed of sound.
Pressure is the force per unit area applied in a direction
perpendicular to the surface of an object. The SI unit for
pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square
meter (N/m2 ).
In physics, the wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial
period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's
shape repeats. The unit for wavelength is the angstrom.
In physics, energy is a quantity that is the ability to do
work. In the International System of Units (SI), energy is
measured in joules, but in some fields other units such as
kilowatt-hours and kilocalories are also used.

54. (a) Refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to
a change in its speed. This is most commonly observed
when a wave passes from one medium to another at any
angle other than 90° or 0°. Refraction of light is the most
commonly observed phenomenon. In both cases the
phenomenon of refraction is applicable because there will
be a change in the direction and speed as light enters from
one media to other. In case 1 light for observer outside


Physics E13
water the light ray is travelling from denser medium (water)
to rarer medium (air). Thus, image of coin will appear closer
due to refraction. Whereas in case 2 for observer under
water refraction also takes place but in opposite way as
light travels from rarer medium (air) to denser medium (water)
.Thus, the image of coin will appear at a higher level than
actual position of coin.

55. (d) The decibel is widely known as a measure of sound
pressure level, but is also used for a wide variety of other
measurements in science and engineering. The decibel is
commonly used in acoustics to quantify sound levels
relative to a 0 dB reference which has been defined as a
sound pressure level of .0002 microbar. The noise level of
100 decibel would corresponds to noise from a machine
shop.

56. (c) A is correct but an image formed on the retina of eye
persists for about 1sec(
0.06sec)16after it changes.

57. (a) Both of the statements are correct and statement 2 is
also correct explanation for statement 
1. Total internal
reflection is an optical phenomenon that happens when a
ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger
than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to
the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side
of the boundary , no light can pass through and all of the
light is reflected. Thus because of this phenomena traffic
light beads glow when light falls on them.

58. (d) The reason CDs reflect rainbow colors is because they
have a clear plastic coating on top of a mirrorized surface. Light
refracts (bends) when it moves from one medium (such as air)
to another with a different optical density (such as the clear
plastic surface of a CD). Different wave lengths of light (every
color has a different wave length) travel at different speeds, so
that full spectrum appears when white light passes from the air
through the plastic surface of a CD, separated light rays which
are then reflected back to us by the mirrorized center surface
of a CD. Here the diffraction and transmission also takes
place because diffraction of light rays occur when it strikes
the surface of CD and transmission is obvious when light
enters from one medium to another. The thickness of the
different optical media, angle of source light, and brightness
of source light all affect which rainbow patterns are visible
on a CD.

59. (c) Statement 1 is true but statement 2 is false. Yes the
stick dipped in water appears to be bent and short but
refraction of light by water molecules is the phenomena
responsible for this observation not because of scattering
of light.

60. (d) When light enters from rarer (air) to denser (glass)
medium wavelength and velocity will get affected. The
velocity will decrease. Moreover, as the ray bent in passing
through different media which results in decrease of
wavelength. As such there is no change in frequency when
light enters from air to glass.

61. (d) Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation,
created whenever a charged object (in normal radio
transmission, an electron) accelerates with a frequency thatlies in the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Thus statement 3 is correct. The Doppler's Effect
shows a change in a wave's frequency received when it is
either reflected from a moving object or generated on a
moving object. Police radar speed detectors bounce a radio
frequency wave off cars and use their internal electronics
to determine the speed at which the object is moving by
that frequency change. Therefore, statement 4 is also correct.

62. (c) Convection currents of hot air rising off a surface have
a lower density than the air directly above it. The difference
in density cause light passing through the air to refract
differently , which causes the formation of mirage.

63. (b) Dust particles are responsible for the diffusion of light
in atmosphere.

64. (c) The velocity of sound in air is determined by the air
itself and is not dependent upon the amplitude, frequency,
or wavelength of the sound. The velocity of sound c
depends on the temperature of air and not on the air pressure.
Thus, velocity of sound in air increases with temperature
and remains unaffected with increase of pressure. Therefore,
statements 1, 2 and 4 are right. Only statement 3 is wrong.
The only other factor that has any effect on the speed of
sound in air is the amount of humidity in the air. An increase
in the amount of humidity in the air increases the speed by
a small amount.

65. (d) The speed of sound is the distance travelled during a
unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic
medium. In dry air at 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound is 
343.2
metres per second (1,126 ft/s). In fresh water, sound travels at
about 1497 m/s at 25 °C. The value of 
331.3 m/s which
represents the 0 °C speed. The speed of sound at 100 °C is
386 m/s. The speed of sound in wood is 3300-3600 m/s.

66. (c) Combination of red and blue colour results into
formation of magenta colour. Where as combination of red
and green colour results in to formation of yellow colour.
Thus on combination of magenta and yellow colour red
colour will be highlighted. On the other side combination
of blue and green results into formation of cyan colour.
Combination of red and blue colour produce magenta colour.
Therefore, on combination of cyan and magenta colours
blue colour will be more highlighted.

67. (d) The flute is a musical instrument of the woodwind
family . A flute of smaller length produces waves of higher
frequency. Sound waves travels through medium rocks in
the form of longitudinal as well as transverse waves.

68. (d) Mach number, a useful quantity in aerodynamics, is
the ratio of air speed to the local speed of sound. The speed
of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and
sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude,
sound is refracted upward. Mach number is a function of
temperature at altitude. With decrease in sound velocity
Mach number increases.

69. (d) Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation.

70. (c) Night Vision as referenced here is that technology that
provides us with the miracle of vision in total darkness and
the improvement of vision in low light environments. Infra-
red waves are used in night vision apparatus.

74. (d) Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward
movement of warm, moist air. They can occur inside
warm, moist air masses and at fronts. As the warm, moist air
moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms
cumulonimbus clouds that can reach heights of over 20 km
(
12.45 miles). The thunderstorms are associated with the
cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds normally form on warm
sunny days but they can also be found on cold front. But
this question is asking about the Thunder i.e. the sound
produced. The lightning generates between 100 million and
1 billion volts of electricity and can heat the air to around
50K°F. The rapid expansion causes the shock waves.
Thunder happens because the lightning would heat the air
at huge temperatures and the air expands so fast that it
make a loud clap of thunder.
D. Electricity and Magnetism

75. (c) A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy
from one circuit to another through inductively coupled
conductors–the transformer's coils. A varying current in
the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux
in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field
through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field
induces a voltage in the secondary winding. By appropriate
selection of the ratio of turns, a transformer thus allows an
alternating current (AC) or voltage to be "stepped up" by
making Ns greater than Np or "stepped down" by making Ns
less than Np.
Here Np represents number of turns in primary winding.
Ns represents the number of turns in secondary winding.As it is clear from principle involved that transformer can be
used to step up and step down A.C. voltage only. This
device can not be used for D.C. voltage as its working is
based on the change of magnetic flux with varying current.

76. (b) In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the
components is the same, and the total current is the sum of
the currents through each component. The wiring for most
homes is parallel .In parallel circuit each branch receives
equal current. If one branch in the circuit is broken, electric
current will still flow in other branches.

77. (c) Iron = Ferromagnetic
Hydrogen = Diamagnetic
Oxygen = Paramagnetic
Nitrogen = Diamagnetic

78. (c) A fuse is a type of sacrificial overcurrent protection
device. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that
melts when too much current flows. Short circuit, overload
or device failure is often the reason for excessive current.
The resistance of the element used in fuse generates heat
due to the current flow. It has low melting point so that it
melts when a short-circuit or overloading takes place.

79. (a) A metallic conductor has a large number of free
electrons in it. When a potential difference is applied across
the ends of a metallic wire, the free electrons begin to drift
from a region of low potential to a region of high potential.
These electrons collide with the positive ions (the atoms
which have lost their electrons). In these collisions, the
energy of the electron is transferred to the positive ions
and they begin to vibrate more violently . As a result, heat is
produced. The greater the number of electrons flowing per
second, the greater will be the rate of collisions and so
greater is the heat produced.

80. (d) The electric light bulb uses a glowing wire filament
heated by electrical resistance to white to generate light (a
process known as thermal radiation). The 'bulb' is the glass
enclosure which keeps the filament in a vacuum or low-
pressure noble gas. Complete evacuation of bulb is not
possible. A small quantity of gases left behind which
expands on heating by heat through filament. Moreover,
the wires supporting the filament sometimes melt due to
high heat generated as a result of high resistance of filament.
Thus, these factors leads to short life span of ordinary bulb.

81. (d) In case of motor car battery or automotive batteries a
nominal 12-volt potential difference is provided by
connecting six galvanic cells in series. Capacity of these
batteries is expressed in ampere-hour. Electrolyte used is a
solution of about 35% sulphuric acid and 65% water and
electrodes used are plates of lead and separate plates of
lead dioxide.

82. (c) A fluorescent lamp or fluorescent tube is a gas-
discharge lamp that uses electricity to excite mercury vapour.
The excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet
light that then causes a phosphor to fluoresce, producing
visible light .In fluorescent tubes the simplest ballast for
alternating current use is an inductor (choke coil ) placed in
series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic
core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC
current on account of its large impedance. The only waste


Physics E15
of energy is due to the hysteresis loss in the iron core,
which is much less than the waste of energy in comparison
to resistance which can also reduce the current if placed
instead of the choking coil.

83. (b) Resistance (R) of a length l, resistivity r and area of

For the two wires,

R lA = 1
\ R1 = R2 = 10 W
(Q r1 : r2 = l1 : l2 = 1 : 2 and A A 1 : A2 = 1 : 4)

84. (d) An alternating current (a.c.) is one which is constantly
changing direction. Alternating current have two cycles
positive half cycle and negative half cycle. Mains electricity
is an a.c. supply which is supplied to homes in India at 220
V AC at 50 Hz. Thus, in our houses the current in A.C.
electricity line changes direction = 50 × 2 = 100 times per
second.

85. (b) Human body has different resistance when human body
dry then the resistance is 105 ohms, and when human body
wet because of water or sweet then the resistance is 1000
ohms, so for dry skin the resistance is 104 ohms. Hence
option (b) is correct.

86. (c) A fluorescent lamp or fluorescent tube is a gas-
discharge lamp that uses electricity to excite mercury vapour.
The excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet
light that then causes a phosphor to fluoresce, producing
visible light. 6500 K is usually printed on a used fluorescent

applications.

94. (a) A nuclear reactor is a device to initiate and control a
sustained nuclear chain reaction. The most common use of
nuclear reactors is for the generation of electrical power
and for the power in some ships. In every fission reaction in
which uranium nuclei splits up to give smaller nuclei three
more neutrons are produced which further results into
splitting of heavy uranium nuclei and more number of
neutrons will be produced. Thus, statement, 1 and 2 are
correct. In nuclear reactor all the neutrons produced can
not take part in fission reaction, else reaction can turn out
extremely violent. Thus, graphite rods are used as a control
rods to slow down the speed of fast moving neutrons. Thus,
statement 3 is also correct.

of general relativity, had suggested that a massive object
would warp space and time. So, statement3 is right. Hence
we are left with correct answer "D": 1, 2 and 3 all correct.

F. Space Physics

101. (c) A cryogenic rocket engine is a rocket engine that uses
a cryogenic fuel or oxidiser, that is, its fuel or oxidizer (or
both) are gases liquefied and stored at very low
temperatures. Notably, these engines were one of the main
factors of the ultimate success in reaching the Moon by the
Saturn V rocket. Various cryogenic fuel-oxidizer
combinations have been tried, but the combination of liquid
hydrogen fuel and the liquid oxygen oxidizer is one of the
most widely used.

102. (d) There is a presence of atmosphere at earth's surface
which consists of thick and moving layers of air. The dust
particles, particulates, smog, water vapour and smoke are
also present in air. Stars twinkle when we see them from the
Earth's surface because we are viewing them through thick
layers of turbulent (moving) air in the Earth's atmosphere.
As their light travels through the many layers of the Earth's
atmosphere, the light of the star is bent (refracted) many
times in random directions (light is bent when it hits a
change in density –like a pocket of cold air or hot air). This
random refraction results in the star as its twinkling but for
a person in spaceship no such refractions are possible as
there is vaccum in space. Thus, star will not twinkle.
Similarly , sky will appear blue to us due to Rayleigh scattering
which is again due to presence of atmosphere on earth's
surface. The shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the
gas molecules of atmosphere. The absorbed blue light is
then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all
around the sky . Some of this scattered blue light reaches
you. Since, you see, the sky looks blue. Whereas no
atmosphere is there in space thus, no absorbing and
scattering is possible that's why for a person in spaceship
sky appears black.
Temperature outside the spaceship is higher in comparison
to earth's surface because of being nearer to sun.
103. (c) The radiation emitted by sun exerts a radial presssure
on the comet. So the tail of comet is always directed away
from the sun.

104. (c) A black hole is a region of space from which nothing,
not even light, can escape. It is the result of the deformation
of spacetime caused by a very compact mass. The simplest
black hole has mass but neither electric charge nor angular
momentum. The mass of a black hole is finite, the reason
why a black hole has infinite density is that it's mass is
concentrated into a space of zero-volume. Thus, it has a
very high density .

105. (c) Statement '2' and '3' is correct, but '1' is incorrect.
Because INSA T–4A was launched on 22 December 2005
from French Guiana.

106. (a) A jet engine combines oxygen from the air with fuel at
high temperature. There is usually a spark to ignite the fuel
vapor, but once the engine begins turning, it will continue
running until it runs out of fuel or air.
A rocket, carries its own supply of liquid oxygen for
combustion.

107. (a) A geostationary orbit (or Geostationary Earth Orbit -
GEO) is a geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's
equator (0° latitude), with a period equal to the Earth's
rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately
zero. It is the part of space about 35,786 km (22,236 miles)
above sea level, in the plane of the equator, where near-
geostationary orbits may be implemented.

108. (d) An artificial satellite moving round the Earth in a
circular orbit possesses an acceleration which is “constant”
in magnitude but “changing in direction”. An artificial
satellite revolves round the earth under centripetal
acceleration. By the launch rocket, immediately before the
satellite is established in the predetermined orbit, the speed
given to it is 30, 000 km/hr. The speed must be great enough
so gravity doesn’t bring the satellite back to Earth, but not
so great that the satellite escapes gravity out into space.
This means that the speed, which is provided by the rocket
is the source of the centrifugal force, and the attraction of
the earth holds it from moving away from this centrifugal
force.

109. (a) Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites are used in
Assessment of crop productivity , Locating ground-water
resources and Mineral exploration. This system was
launched in 1979 and 
1981. This system is used in
agriculture, water resources, forestry and ecology, geology,
marine fisheries and coastal management. It is the largest
constellation of the remote sensing satellites.

2NiO(OH) + Cd + 2H2O « 2Ni(OH)2 + Cd(OH)2

3. (c) Yellow cakes generally denotes various compounds
of uranium like uranium oxides.

4. (b) Nuclear fission is a perfect example of chain reaction.
In case of nuclear fission a heavy atomic nucleus (such as
that of uranium) disintegrates into two nearby equal
fragments with release of large amount of energy when large
number of nuclei are brought closer together. In such a case
the neutrons released, when one nucleus splits, strikes
other nuclei causing them to split and the process continues.
Now atomic bomb and nuclear reactor both works on nuclear
fission chain reaction but chain reaction in nuclear reactor
is controlled by control rods, made up of metal cadmium or
boron a neutron absorbing material, whereas in atomic bomb
there is no neutron absorber. So chain reaction goes
uncontrolled and is very violent.

5. (b) Each alpha particle contains two protons and two
neutrons.
Total number of nucleons = Number of protons +
Number of neutrons
 = 2 + 2 = 4
Total number of nucleons = Mass number of an
element
Thus mass number of alpha particle is 4 which is equal to
molecular weight of helium atom.

resistance, and satisfactory neutron damage resistance.

8. (c) Barium is given in adequate amount to patients before
X-ray examination. The gut (gastrointestinal tract) does not
show up very well on ordinary X-ray pictures. However, if
you drink a white liquid that contains a chemical called
barium sulphate, the outline of the upper parts of the gut
(oesophagus, stomach and small intestines) shows up clearly
on X-ray pictures. This is because X-rays do not pass
through barium.

9. (c) Cobalt-60 is useful as a gamma ray source because it
can be produced in predictable quantity and high activity
by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. This is commonly used
in radiation therapy for treatment of cancer.

10. (a) Ammonia is used as a large scale refrigerant because it
has highest refrigerating capacity per pound of any
refrigerant and a number of other excellent thermal properties
that make it popular for a number of refrigeration applications
in spite of its being toxic, explosive and flammable within
certain conditions. Ammonia is used as refrigerant promine-
ntly in the refrigeration systems of food industry like dairies,
ice creams plants, frozen food production plants, cold
storage warehouses, processors of fish, meat and number
of other applications. Comparatively chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home
and consumer use.

11. (c) Mixing of methane with air is the cause of most mining
explosions.

12. (a) Aufbau principle states that 'in the ground state of the
atom, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing
energies, starting with the orbital of lowest energy .' The

6s, 4f, 5d, 6p.

13. (c) As it is given that half life of given substance is 4
months.
The amount of substance left after 4 months = 1/2
The amount of substance left after 8 months = 1/4
Therefore the amount of substance decay in 8 months = (1

16. (a) Ionic compound is a chemical compound in which ions
are held together in a lattice structure by ionic bonds. Following
the aphorism, "like dissolves like", ionic compounds dissolve
in polar solvents, especially those that ionize, such as water
and ionic liquids. They are usually appreciably soluble in other
polar solvents such as alcohols, acetone. Solid ionic

18. (a) Liquid sodium is used as a coolant because water is
difficult to use as a coolant for a fast reactor because water
acts as a neutron moderator that slows the fast neutrons
into thermal neutrons. While it may be possible to use
supercritical water as a coolant in a fast reactor, this would
require a very high pressure. In contrast, sodium atoms are
much heavier than both the oxygen and hydrogen atoms
found in water, and therefore the neutrons lose less energy
in collisions with sodium atoms. Sodium also need not be
pressurized since its boiling point is higher than the reactor's
operating temperature. A disadvantage of sodium is its
chemical reactivity , which requires special precautions to
prevent and suppress fires. If sodium comes into contact
with water it explodes, and it burns when in contact with air.

magnesium and sulphur).
Micronutrients (iron, copper, manganese, zinc, boron,
molybdenum and chlorine).
Additional mineral nutrient elements which are beneficial
but not necessary are sodium, cobalt, vanadium, nickel,

31. (d) Amalgam is an alloy consisting of mercury and any
other element.Iron being exceptional in nature not form
amalgam with mercury. That's why mercury is stored in
vessels made up of iron. Small quantities of an iron amalgam
have, however, been formed by immersing sodium amalgam
(containing 1 percent sodium) in a clear, saturated solution
of ferrous sulphate.While rest three options zinc,copper
and magnesium combine with mercury to form there
respective amalgam.

32. (c) Sodium metal is generally kept inside kerosene oil
because of its extreme reactive nature. In open air it reacts
violently and burns vigorously to form sodium oxide .

33. (a) Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) reacts very vigorously with
water, in a highly exothermic reaction. Thus if you add water
to concentrated sulfuric acid, it can boil and you may get a
nasty acid burn. That's why for dilution, acid is added to
water not water to acid as specific heat of water is quite
large and it can absorb large quantity of heat produced by
sulphuric acid. Moreover water is less dense than sulphuric
acid, so if you pour water on the acid, the reaction occurs
on top of the liquid. If you add the acid to the water, it sinks
and any wild and crazy reactions have to get through the
water or beaker to get to you.

34. (d) Diamonds is the polymorph of the element carbon.
Calcium is the basic element of naturally occuring marble.
Sand is formed by Silicon and Aluminium is the basic element

36. (d) Nichrome is a non-magnetic alloy of nickel, chromium,
and iron, usually used as a resistance wire. A common alloy
is 80% nickel and 20% chromium, by mass. This alloying
provide nichrome properties like hardness and ductility .

37. (b) Anodizing or anodising in British English, is an
electrolytic passivation process used to increase the
thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal
parts. The process is called "anodizing" because the part to
be treated forms the anode electrode of an electrical circuit.
Anodizing increases corrosion and wear resistance. The
anodized aluminium layer is grown by passing a direct
current through an electrolytic solution, with the aluminium
object serving at the anode. The current releases hydrogen
at the cathode and oxygen at the surface of the aluminium
anode, creating a build up of aluminium oxide layer.
38. (d) Hardness of water is due to presence of chlorides,
sulphates and nitrates of calcium and magnesium. Hard water
cannot be used for washing purposes as soap do not form
lather with hard water easily which results in to wastage of
soap in laundaries. Moreover use of hard water in industries
results in to scale formation in inner layers of boilers on
which insoluble calcium and magnesium carbonates gets
deposited and being a bad conductor of heat result in to
wastage of energy . Moreover hard water is not fit for drinking
purpose as it hinders ionic imbalance in body . Repeated
irrigation of crops by hard water increases calcium and
magnesium ions in soil which increases soil alkalinity .

39. (c) Aqueous solution of copper sulphate is acidic in nature
because copper sulphate on dissolving with water, following
chemical reaction takes place
CuSO4(s) + 2H2O ¾ ¾® Cu(OH)2(l) + H2SO4(aq)
Now as we can see in above chemical equation the sulphuric
acid generated is strong mineral acid which results into
increase in acidity of solution. Thus aqueous solution of
copper sulphate is acidic in nature.

40. (b) The electron affinity of a molecule or atom is the
energy change when an electron is added to the neutral
atom to form a negative ion. This property can only be
measured in an atom in gaseous state.
X + e– ¾ ¾® X–
Down a group, the electron affinity decreases because of a
large increase in the atomic radius, electron-electron repulsion
and the shielding effect of inner electrons against the valence
electrons of the atom. As one moves from left to right across
a period in the periodic table, the electronegativity increases
due to the stronger attraction that the atoms obtain as the
nuclear charge increases. There will be an increase of
ionization energy from left to right in a given period.

41. (a) The oxidation number characterises the oxidation state
of an element in a compound. It is a full number, positive or
negative, which indicates the amount of electron loss or
gain by this element in the given compound, with respect to
the neutral atom. Oxidation number of calcium is 2 in calcium
oxide (CaO). Oxidation number of Aluminium is +3 in Sodium
aluminium hydride (NaAlH4) is a chemical compound used
as a reducing agent.
Oxidation number of manganese is 4 in Manganese dioxide
(MnO2).
Oxidation number of sulphur is 6 in Pyrosulfuric Acid
(H2S2O7).

42. (a) Synthetic detergents are sodium salt of long chain
sulphonic acid or alkyl hydrogen sulphate. Hardness in
water is due to presence of chlorides, sulphates and nitrates
salts of calcium and magnesium. Now detergents are capable
of forming soluble salts even with the calcium and
magnesium ions present in hard water and forms lather
easily in hard water.

43. (d) Barium and Strontium are alkaline earth metals. They
are quite reactive in nature, they do not occur in free state.
Strontium is a relatively abundant element in the Earth's crust.
The most common minerals containing strontium are celestine
and strontianite. Celestine contains primarily strontium sulfate
(SrSO4), while strontianite contains mostly strontium
carbonate (SrCO3). The most common naturally occurring
minerals containing barium are the very insoluble barium
sulfate, BaSO4 (barite), and barium carbonate, BaCO3(witherite).

Topicwise Solved PapersE26

44. (d) A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down
the groups in the periodic table would be expected. The
additional electron will be entering in an orbital farther away
from the nucleus, and thus would experience a lesser
effective nuclear charge. It is fairly obvious that the atoms
get bigger as you go down group with the increase in atomic
number. The reason is equally obvious-you are adding
extra layers of electrons.

45. (b) Coal based thermal power plants contribute to acid
rain because SO2 and NO2 are emitted from these plants
which form H2SO4 and HNO3 in atmosphere, that cause
acid rain. Oxides of carbon are emitted when coal burns, but
it does not contribute to acid rain.

46. (d) Baking soda is a great as a fire extinguisher for electrical
fires and grease fires. When baking soda is heated it releases
carbon dioxide and produces water.
2NaHCO3 ¾ ¾® H2O + CO2 + Na2CO3Since carbon dioxide is heavier than air and does not support
combustion like oxygen does, it smothers the fire while water
that is formed cools the fire to below ignition temperature.
Calcium oxide, chemical compound, CaO is also called lime,
quicklime, or caustic lime. Calcium oxide is widely used in
making porcelain and glass.
Plaster of Paris is a type of building material based
on calcium sulphate hemihydrate nominally CaSO

47. (c) Creating firework colors is a complex endeavor,
requiring considerable art and application of physical
science. Strontium and barium both are alkaline earth metal
and are extremely reactive. They both impart characteristic
color to flame. Strontium salts impart a red color to fireworks.
Strontium compounds are also important for stabilizing
fireworks mixtures. Barium is used to create green colors in
fireworks, and it can also help stabilize other volatile
elements.

48. (b) Solder is a fusible metal alloy with a melting point or
melting range of 90 to 450 degree Celsius (190 to 840 °F),
used in a process called soldering where it is melted to join
metallic surfaces. It is especially useful in electronics and
plumbing. Solder is an alloy of lead and tin.

49. (b) Sulphur is the best electrical insulating material known,
with a resistivity of about 2 × 1023 mW-cm. The reason for
this large resistivity is probably the electron traps produced
by thermal breaking of S8 rings. Electrical conductivity of
sulphur is 
5.0 × 10–14 S m–
1. Electrical conductivity of
selenium is 8 × 106 S m–
1. Electrical conductivity of bromine
is 
1.0 × 10–10 S m–
1. Electrical conductivity of phosphorous

1.0 × 10–9 S m–
1. Thus from this data it is clear that electrical
conductivity of selenium is maximum.

50. (c) Philosopher's wool is a oxide of zinc a white powder
used as a pigment, cosmetics, glass, inks and in zinc
ointment.

51. (b) German silver has a color resembling silver, but is an
alloy of primarily copper, nickel and zinc. Chlorargyrite is
the mineral form of silver chloride (AgCl). It is also known
as horn silver. Proustite is a sulfosalt mineral consisting of
silver sulfarsenide, Ag3AsS3, known also as light red silver
or ruby silver ore, and an important source of the metal.
Silver nitrate is an inorganic compound with chemical formula
AgNO
3. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was
called luna by the ancient alchemists.
52. (b) Rubies and Sapphires are scientifically the same stone,
differing only in color. Corundum, the predominating mineral
of both, is composed of nearly pure alumina (Al2O3).The
coloring substance which differentiates rubies and sapphires
is believed to be chromium.

53. (c) Xenon is called the ‘stranger’ gas. This gas very un-
reactive and heavier than air, that was why named strange
(in greek it means ‘xenon’).

54. (b) The lightest metal in the periodic table is lithium (Li)
with atomic number 3 density 
0.53 kg/L. Lithium metal is
extremely soft (and highly reactive) and so is unusable for
many applications. Osmium is a hard metallic element which
has the greatest density of all known elements. It is twice as
heavy as lead, and has a specific gravity of 
22.
59.

55. (b) Smelting units and paints are the source of the lead
poisoning.

56. (a) The burning of fossil fuel can create another
atmospheric pollution problem known as Photochemical
Smog. Photochemical smog is a condition that develops
when primary pollutants like oxides of nitrogen, V olatile
organic compounds created from fossil fuel combustion
interact under the influence of sunlight to produce
secondary pollutants. The major chemical pollutants in
P ho to c he mi c al s m o g a re N O a n d N O2, VOCs(volatile
organic compounds), Ozone(O3) and PAN (Peroxyacetyl
Nitrate). NO2 decreases visibility due to yellowish colour. It
also contributes to heart and lung problem. Ozone(O3)
contributes to bronchial constriction, coughing and
wheezing. PAN causes eye irritation, high toxicity to plants.

57. (b) Chemical changes occur when a substance combines
with another to form a new substance. Crystallization of
sodium chloride is not a chemical as water of crystallization
can be lost to get salt again . Similarly melting of ice is
reversible .However souring of milk is a chemical change as
it is not reversible and a new compound is formed.

58. (d)
• Steel slag, an unavoidable by-product in iron and
steel production. Developed countries like Japan, USA
have taken lead in making fertilisers using steel-making
slag, says 2018’s article in Financial Express So, #2 is
correct.
• Steel Slag is used in road metal and bases,
producing portland slag cement. It is also used for soil
conditioning. Says Handbook of Indian Bureau of mines
page 
6. So, All #3 statements correct.
C. Organic Chemistry

59. (d) Polycarbonates are the polymer widely used in making
bullet proof material. Bullet proof glass is made by layering
a polycarbonate material between pieces of ordinary glass
in a process called lamination. A bullet fired will pierce the
outside layer of the glass, but the layered polycarbonate
glass material is able to absorb the bullet's energy and stop
it. Polycarbonate panels are used for covering advertising
posters, construction of office buildings for sound proofing
and polycarbonate is also used for making bullet proof jackets.

60. (d ) Methyl alcohol is very dangerous. May be fatal or cause
blindness if swallowed. Harmful, if inhaled or absorbed through
skin. It cannot be made non poisonous. Some other harmful
effects are results into irritation of skin, eyes and respiratory
track. It can also effects central nervous system and liver.

61. (b) Allicin is an oily , yellow liquid, which gives garlic its
characteristic odour which is due to the R–S(O)–S-R group. It
also has a range of medical properties.

62. (b) Oil of cloves, also known as Clove oil, is an essential
oil obtained from the clove plant. It is a natural analgesic
and antiseptic used primarily in dentistry for its main
ingredient eugenol. The oil produced by cloves can be used
in many things from flavouring medicine to remedies for
bronchitis, common cold, a cough, fever, sore throat and
tending to infections.

63. (c) The most effective gas of the first world war was
mustard gas a vesicent, which was introduced by Germany
in July 
1917. Mustard gas is not a particularly effective killing
agent but the skin of its victims got blistered, their eyes
became very sore and they began to vomit. Mustard gas
caused internal and external bleeding and attacked the
bronchial tubes.

64. (a) Fuel value can be expressed in terms of calorific value
of fuel. The calorific value of a fuel is the amount of heat
produced by burning 1 kg of fuel. Hydrogen has the highest
calorific value of (141,790 KJ/kg ) thus have highest fuel
value. Calorific value of charcoal, natural gas and gasoline are
(29,600; 43,000; 47,300 kJ/kg) respectively. Natural gas majorly
consists of methane.

65. (d) Ethylene glycol solutions are marketed as "permanent
anti-freeze", and is used as anti-freeze agent for the
automobile engine in cold countries where temperature is
below zero degree centigrade.

66. (a) Antiseptic are antimicrobial substances that are applied
to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection,
sepsis, or putrefaction. Now phenyl being a phenol
derivative possesses effective germicidal properties because
phenol is germicidal in strong solution.

67. (a) Welding refers to the process of joining two or more
metals together. Approximately 20% of acetylene is
consumed for oxyactylene gas welding and cutting due to
high temperature of flame. Combustion of acetylene with
oxygen produces a flame of over 3600 K (3300°C, 6000°F).
Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas.
Oxyacetylene welding was a very popular welding process
in previous decades; however the development and
advantages of arc-based welding process have made oxy
fuel welding nearly extinct. This high temperature of flame
makes head of metal pieces to be joined melt and they
joined together when solidified on cooling.
Following is the chemical reaction occurring in above
process:
2C2H2 + 5O2 ¾ ¾® 4CO2 + 2H2O
The polymerization of acetylene with Ziegler – Natta catalyst
produces polyacetylene films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH
centres with alternating single and double bonds, was the
one of first discovered organic semiconductors.

68. (b) Formic acid is stronger than acetic acid due to its
chemical composition. Formic acid is an organic acid.
69. (b) Cracking is the process whereby complex organic
molecules such as kerosene or heavy hydrocarbons are
broken down into simpler molecules such as light
hydrocarbons, by the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds.
Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main use is to
produce a metal from its ore. In this process the oxide ore is
reduced to free metal by using reducing agents like coke or
charcoal. Copper is also obtained from its oxide by this
method in free state.
Hydrogenation is a reduction reaction which results in an
addition of hydrogen (usually as H2). If an organic
compound is hydrogenated, it becomes more 'saturated'.
Hydrogenation results in the conversion of liquid vegetable
oils to solid (edible) fats.
Vulcanization is a chemical process for converting rubber
into more durable materials via the addition of sulphur.
Sulphur modify the rubber by forming crosslinks (bridges)
between individual polymer chains. Vulcanized material is
less sticky and has superior mechanical properties.

70. (a) As molecular weight increases with increase in the
length of carbon-carbon chain.

71. (c) The addition of silicates to synthetic detergents has
proved very beneficial. Silicates soften water by the
formation of precipitates that can be easily rinsed away .
Soluble silicates contribute to detergents as cleaning aids,
processing aids, and corrosion inhibitors. As cleaning aids,
soluble silicates provide alkalinity and promote soil
suspension. Sodium sulphate is simply a filler in detergent
powder, in much the same way as fillers are used in many
medical tablets, it doesn't play any active role as such.

72. (b) Compressed natural gas (CNG) is made by compressing
natural gas which is composed of methane (CH4), it also
contain small amount of ethane.
Coal gas typically contains hydrogen, methane and carbon
monoxide.
LPG is the abbreviation or short form of Liquefied Petroleum
gas. The major constituents of LPG is propane and butane.
Water gas is a synthesis gas, containing carbon monoxide
and hydrogen.

73. (b) Liquified Natural Gas or LNG is natural gas
(predominantly methane, CH4) that has been converted
temporarily to liquid form for ease of storage or transport.
The liquefaction process involves removal of certain
components, such as dust, acid gases, helium, water, and
heavy hydrocarbons, which could cause difficulty
downstream. The natural gas is then condensed into a liquid
maximum transport pressure set at around 25 kPa/
3.6 psi by
cooling it to approximately –162 °C (–260 °F).
Dahej, in India has begun its first import of natural gas.
Natural gas liquids recovery (NGL) involves refrigerated
gas plants, turboexpanders, debutanizers, depropanizers,
and JT plants. NGL can be separated using debutanizers
and depropanizers into propane, butane, naphtha, etc.

74. (d) V arieties of LPG bought and sold include mixes that
are primarily propane and butane, the common, mixes include
propane (60%) and butane (40%), depending on the season
in winter more propane, in summer more butane. Propylene
and butylenes are usually also present in small
concentration. A powerful odorant, ethanethiol, is added
so that leaks can be detected easily.
Methane is a chemical compound with the chemical formula
(CH4). Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, burning
methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat

released. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for
domestic heating and cooking purposes. Methane in the
form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel.
Methane is used in industrial chemical processes for the
production of hydrogen, methanol, acetic acid, and acetic
anhydride, also used as a fuel in factories.

75. (c) Dry cleaning is a cleaning process for clothing and
textiles involves using a chemical solvents other then water.
The solvent used is typically trichloroethylene while carbon
tetra chloride and tri chloroethane is used historically .
Benzene is other common agent used for this purpose.

76. (d) RDX, an initialism for Research Department Explosive,
is an explosive nitroamine widely used in military and industrial
applications. It is also known less commonly as cyclonite. Its
chemical name is cyclotrimethylene trinitramine.

77. (c) Bisphenol A, commonly abbreviated as BPA, is an
organic compound with two phenol functional groups.
Bisphenol A is used primarily to make plastics which is used
in making food packaging material.It is a key monomer in
production of epoxy resins and used to make polycarbonate
plastic. Polycarbonate plastic, which is clear and nearly
shatter-proof, is used to make a variety of common products
including baby and water bottles, sports equipment, medical
and dental devices, dental fillings and sealants, eyeglass
lenses, CDs and DVDs, and household electronics.

78. (c) Cause of blast in a mine in generally mixture of methane
and air. CH4 in the main gas exerted from a mine, when it
comes in contact with air, explosions take place.

79. (d) Nitroglycerine (NG) also known as nitroglycerine,
trinitroglycerin, trinitroglycerine, 1,2,3-trinitroxypropane and
glyceryl trinitrate is a heavy , colorless, oily, explosive liquid
obtained by nitrating glycerol. Alfred Nobel discovered that
mixing nitroglycerin with diatomaceous earth would turn
the liquid into a paste, called dynamite. An advantage of
dynamite was that it could be cylinder-shaped for insertion
into the drilling holes used for mining.

80. (c) Chlorofluorocarbons are used in the production of
plastic foams, in cleaning electronic components and as
pressurizing agents in aerosol cans.

81. (c) Bagasse is often used as a primary fuel source as it
produces sufficient heat energy. Molasses can be used for
the production of Ethanol. Ethanol is produced by the age
old technique of fermentation of cereals, grams, molasses
and other materials with high starch contents. Molasses is
an inexpensive and readily available raw material.
Molasses cannot be used as a synthetic fertilizer as
molasses contain calcium, magnesium and Iron where as
synthetic fertilizers are comprised of NPK i.e. Nitrogen,
Phosphorous and Potassium.

82. (b) 2018-July: IndianExpress
• Compared to conventional CNG, use of H-CNG can
reduce emissions of carbon monoxide up to 70% so #1 is
wrong, because it doesn’t ‘eliminate CO emission’.
• Same Indian Express article reads: For consumers who
pay Rs 42 per kg for CNG , the cost of H-CNG would not be
more than Rs 43 per kg. NITI Aayog-CII Action Plan for
Clean Fuel notes that physical blending of CNG and
hydrogen involves a series of energy-intensive steps that
would make H-CNG more expensive than CNG . So, #4 is
wrong. By elimination we are left with answer B: only 2 and 
3.

83. (a) WTI is associated with crude oil trade in USA.D. Environmental Chemistry

84. (d) America used Dioxin which is defoliants to clear the
forests of Vietnam, so that is could kill the Vietnamese guerilla
hiding in the forest. But the Dioxin had many after effects
like cancers, miscarriage, and birth defects in after years.

85. (c) Except hydrogen, all the rest three options diesel, coal
and kerosene are either naturally occurring fossil fuels or
derived from them. Thus as we know naturally occuring
fossil fuels and their products have high percentage of
carbon which on combustion lead to discharge of oxides by
carbon (CO2 & CO) in air. This results in to heavy
environmental pollution like CO2 results in to green house
effect causes global warming While CO is poisonous in
nature, it combines with haemoglobin of blood to form
carboxyhaemoglobin. Hydrogen fuel as such causes no
pollution because on combustion with oxygen it forms water
that's why it is also called future fuel.

86. (c) Aquatic macrophytes, aquatic fungi are natural
organism and evapotranspiration is a natural process by
which plant losses water. Thus being natural they do not
results into any change in physico-chemical characteristics
of water while effluents discharged into water bodies by
industrial units and domestic sewage results in to change
in physico-chemical characteristics like pH, conductivity ,
temperature, electrical conductivity , dissolved oxygen,
biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand,
4NH+ and –
3NO ion contents etc.

87. (d) Water pollution in river or any other water body is
measured by amount of dissolved oxygen. Water pollution
can be measured on the basis of parameters like dirtyness,
change in texture, total suspended solid and other important
factors like,

1. Decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) (concentration of
dissolved oxygen in water samples).

2. Increase in BOD, (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) it is a
chemical procedure for determining the amount of dissolved
oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms in a body
of water to break down organic material present in a given
water sample at certain temperature over a specific time
period.

3. Increase in COD, (Chemical Oxygen Demand) test is
commonly used to indirectly measure the amount of organic
compounds in water.

88. (b) During the photochemical smog oxides of nitrogen are
produced.

89. (b) Ilmenite, Zirecon and Sillimanite are found in kollam
district in Kerala but tungsten is not found in the beach
sands of Kerala.

90. (c) Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation
that is unusually acidic, i.e. elevated levels of hydrogen
ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic
animals, and infrastructure through the process of wet
deposition. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides which react with the water molecules in
the atmosphere to produce corresponding sulphuric and
nitric acids which falls along with rain droplets on ground.

91. (b) Carbon Monoxide pollution occurs primarily from
emissions produced by fossil fuel powered engines. The
incomplete reaction of air with fuel produces the colourless,
odourless and highly toxic gas. The main issue with Carbon
Monoxide is its health effects. It is capable of binding to the


Chemistry E29
chemicals in our blood, called haemoglobin. It does so far
more effectively than oxygen and also stays bound to the
haemoglobin for far longer than oxygen does. The effect is
that the blood is starved of oxygen, which then affects the
rest of the body.

92. (d) By products of power thermal plant operation need to
be considered in both the design and operation. Waste heat
due to the finite efficiency of the power cycle must be
released to the atmosphere, using a cooling tower, or river
or lake water as a cooling medium. The gas from combustion
of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air; this contains
carbon dioxide and water vapour, as well as other substances
such as nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and (in
the case of coal-fired plants) fly ash, mercury and traces of
other metals.

93. (a) Ultraviolet radiation inactivates / kills harmful micro
organisms in water only .

94. (d) Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins
when compounds of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
react with molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.

95. (a) Fly ash brick (FAB) is a building material, specifically
masonry units, containing class C fly ash and water. All fly
ash includes substantial amounts of silicon dioxide (SiO2)
aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and calcium oxide (CaO), the main
mineral compunds in coal-bearing rock strata. Fly ash can
be used as a replacement for some of the Portland cement
contents of concrete.

96. (c) Brominated flame retardants used in many household
products are highly resistant to degradation in the
environment and they are able to accumulate in humans
and animals.
97. (d) Shell gas contains methane, according to first
statement, it contains propane and butane which is wrong.
The source of shell gas is available in India. So the statement
(2) is also wrong.

98. (d) Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer
in Chinese food, but leads to obesity and liver inflation.
This was in news because of Maggie noodles controvery.
So, 3 is right.
•Brominated vegetable oils are used as stabilizers in
the baked goods, soft drinks, soups, jellies etc. but
banned in UK after 
1970. so, #2 is right.
There is only one combination where 1 and 3 are together
i.e. answer "D": 1, 2 and 3 are correct.

99. (d)
•Pyrolysis is a process of combustion in absence of
oxygen or the material burnt under controlled atmosphere
of oxygen. It is an alternative to incineration. The gas
and liquid thus obtained can be used as fuels.

100. (a) 2017-IndianExpress
•The Ministry of Agriculture has issued a notification
inviting objections and suggestions from the stakeholders
on completely banning pesticides/insecticides including
Benomyl, Carbaryl, Diazinon, Fenarimol, Fenthion, Linuron,
MEMC, Methyl Parthion, Sodium Cyanide, Thiometon,
Tridemorph, Trifluralin, Alachlor, Dichlorvos, Phorate,
Phosphamidon, Triazophos and Trichlorfon. So, A is the
right answer.

in India, whereas Pangolins are found in tropical Asia and
Africa.
135. (b) Lymphocytes are the cells that determine the specificity
of the immune response to infectious microorganisms and
other foreign substances. In humans lymphocytes make up
25 to 33% of the total number of leukocytes. Lymphocytes
cells originate from bone marrow of long bones and Hen
migrate to lymphatic system.
136. (c) Assertion is true because a balanced diet is a diet which
contains the correct amount of carbohydrates, proteins and
fats. But the reason is false, because human body cells
synthesize various fatty acids except linoleic and linolenic
fatty acids.
137. (a)
•The largest bone in human body is femur.

the bites of infective female Aedes mosquito. The symptoms
of disease is characterized by high fever, severe muscle
pain, joint pain and rashes in body.
139. (d) All are infectious diseases.
140. (d) Assertion is false because protein digestion occurs in
stomach and small intestine. But reason is true because the
proteolytic enzyme from pancreas secretion immediately
enters to small intestine from the stomach.
141. (a) Assertion is correct and reason is the correct
explanation of assertion.
Amoeba is a unicellular animal. It reproduce by the process
of asexual reproduction. Fission is one of the processes of
asexual reproduction, where amoeba divides in half to
produce off spring.
142. (c) Assertion is correct but the reason is false.
Deficiency of vasopressin results Diabetes insipidus . In
this disease the patients produce enormous quantities of
dilute urine and the patient consequently feels thirsty.
143. (b) Pneumoconiosis is a respiratory disease caused by
the inhaling various type of dust, such as coal dust, silica
dust, asbestos dust etc. So, it is very common in workers of
coal mining industries and related industries.
144. (b) Bile duct and pancreatic duct both releases its contents
into duodenum. The digestive enzyme (pancreatic juices)
releases to duodenum from pancreatic duct.
145. (a) Rice is not a good source of calcium.
146. (d) Caffeine is most commonly consumed by humans in
infusions extracted from the bean of the coffee plant and
the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods
and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut.
Acids are added to soft drinks for extra bite and mouth feel.The primary acid used in colas is phosphoric acid, while the
one used in citrus flavoured drinks is usually citric acid.
Citric acid is a good substitution of ascorbic acid as per
nutritional value.
147. (d) ELISA Test is employed as the first and most basic
test for an indivisual to detect HIV/AIDS. 85% of human
beings possess Rh+ and and 15% are Rh–. Rh+ and Rh– are
the factors present in blood, discovered by Karl Landsteiner.
148. (d) Hepatic portal vein deliver the nutrient rich blood from
the stomach and small intestine to the liver. It is the largest
gland in the body.
149. (b) Cloning a human embryo for the first time took place in
U.SA. Cloning is a process when identical types of progenies
are produced from one individual.
150. (b) Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted from person
to person through cough and having a body contact on a
regular basis. It is called droplet transmission.
151. (b) Robert Webster is a scientist, his interests include the
structure and function of influenza virus proteins and
development of new vaccines and antivirals.
152. (a) Appendix is attached to the first portion of large
intestine. The appendix has no function in modern human.
153. (c) Parathyroid hormone secrets from parathyroid gland.
This hormone regulates calcium and phosphate level in
blood. Parathyroid hormone raises the level of calcium in
the blood and decreases the level of phosphorous in the
blood.
154. (d) Most insects respire through tracheal system that lies
on a network of small tubes that channel O2 directly to the
different part of the body. The tracheal system is composed
of chitin-ringed tubes called trachea that connect directly
to the air through opening in the body wall called spiracles.
155. (b) Fallopian tube is a tube like structure that carries egg
from the ovary to uterus. In this tube the sperm meets to
ovum and fertilization occurs.
156. (c) The bottom part of the brain stem is called the Medulla
oblongata. The medulla oblongata has nerve centres to
control many vital body processes like swallowing, vomiting,
breathing and heart beat etc.
157. (b) Urea is the main nitrogenous excretory product of
Ureotelic animals, produced by liver cells from
de-aminated excess amino-acids via the urea cycle.
158. (b) Gastrin is a hormone, which stimulates secretion of
digestive enzyme in stomach. Trypsin, Pepsin and Ptyalin
are the digestive enzymes of human system.
159. (d) The correct sequence in the order of decreasing length
of the three structural parts are Ileum – Jejunum –
Duodenum of small intestine.
160. (c) Sexual cannibalism is identified only in spiders. In
which female organism kills the male before during or after
copulation. In most species in which it occurs, sexual
connibalism is related to the larger size of female due to
sexual dimorphism.
161. (d) King cobra feeds on other snakes.
162. (c) Blood is slightly alkaline and the pH of blood varies
from
7.35 –
7.
45.
163. (c) The liver secretes bile that forms and stores glycogen
and plays an important role in metabolism of protein and
Topicwise Solved PapersE48
fat. It does not contain digestive enzymes and as such does
not take part directly in digestion.
164. (a) Echinda is a mammal that lay eggs.
165. (c) Gambusia affinis is a larvivorous fish. This fish is
released into ponds and wells. It feeds on mosquito larvae,
insects and crustaceans.
166. (c) Gibbon , Gorilla and Orangutan are apes, but Langur
is not an ape, it is monkey.
167. (d)
From the above graphical presentation we concluded that
the son is the colourblind but the daughter is the carrier.
168. (a) Bats are commonly known as fruits bats or flying foxes.
In India these are present in North-Eastern parts or in
Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
169. (c) According to evolution of living organisms
Salamander-Python-Kangaroo, because the evolution
started from amphibians 350 million years ago, reptiles
appeared 300 million years ago and 200 million years ago
first small mammals appeared.
170. (a) Panda and bear belongs to family Ursidae. Pandas are
medium sized bears. Of all the endangered bear species they
have the most distinguished colour combination.
171. (d) Dugong is a large marine mammal. Dugong has a
fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs, instead of
possessing paddle. Dugong is heavily dependent on
seagrass for subsistence. Dugong bear one calf at a time
after an approximately 13 month gestation.
172. (b) It is difficult to develop an effective malaria vaccine,
because repeated natural infection does not produce
detectable resistance to exo-erythrocytic cycle of malaria in
man.
173. (c) Hepatitis-B is a potentially life-threatening liver
infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It can cause
chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death
from cirrhoris of liver and liver cancer.
Hepatitis-B virus is transmitted between people by contact
with blood or other body fluid of an contact with the blood
or other body fluid.
174. (d) Aspartame is metabolized by the body into two
constituent amino acids and methanol. These hydrolysis
products are handled by the body in the same way as
aspartic acid, L-Phenylanine and methanol from other
consumed foods. These components yield no calorie and
add nothing new to the diet.
175. (d) Human Genome Project is not at all limited to only
genetic diseases. There are some 30K genes and the genome
sequence would provide great help to build the tools to
conquer diseases. Here we must note that all diseases have
a genetic component, whether inherited (genetic) or
resulting from the body’s response to environmental
stresses like viruses or toxins. The successes of the HGP
have even enabled researchers to pinpoint errors in genes–
the smallest units of heredity–that cause or contribute to
disease. Thus second statement stands correct.
176. (d) A type of trans fat occurs naturally in the milk and
body fat of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep) at a level
of 2–5% of total fat. Natural trans fats, which include
conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate
in the rumen of these animals.
177. (a) The b lo o d gro up o f the parents are AB and O; the
biological child’s blood group may be A or B and since the
boy is adopted and it is given in the question that “ the
blood group of the three sons are A+, B+, O+”.
178. (c) Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals. In turn,
these radicals can start chain reactions. When the chain
reaction occurs in a cell, it can cause damage or death. When
the chain reaction occurs in a purified monomer, it produces
a polymer resin, such as a plastic, a synthetic fibre, or an oil
paint film. Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by
removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other
oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized
themselves, so antioxidants are often reducing agents such
as thiols, ascorbic acid, orpolyphenols.
179. (b) Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen.
180. (d) All of them are pollinating agents.
181. (c) Aflatoxins are produced by many species of
Aspergillus, a fungus. Aspergillus Flavus and Aspergillus
parasiticus are weedy moulds that grow on a large number
of substrates, particular under high moisture conditions.
182. (c) Excretion of urea by animals adds nitrogen to the soil,
as urea is the main nitrogen containing substance in the
urine of mammals, therefore urea is widely used in fertilizers
as the convenient source of nitrogen.
Death of vegetation adds up in soil organic matters including
humus. As organic matters decompose inorganic nitrogen
is released into the soil.
183. (b) Body piercing or getting one’s body tattooed may cost
one a huge price- Infection of Hepatitis B and C virus is
absolutely possible. The needle used in the act may just be
infected with the said virus causing liver disease, which in
its ultimate stage often turns cancerous. This is deemed to
happen if the needle is not properly sterilized.
184. (c) Calcium is the most common and abundant mineral in
the body . It is important for healthy bones and teeth, helps
muscle relax and contract, important in nerve functioning,
blood clotting etc. Sodium is needed for proper fluid balance,
nerve transmission and muscle contraction.
185. (b) Sea cow is a mammal. It is a herbivore and it grows up
to 9 meters. It looks like a large seal. Sea horse is a fish not
a mammal. Sea lion is a mammal. It is a carnivore. It is also
known as eared seal.
186. (a) Viruses have no metabolic enzymes and cannot generate
their own energy. Viruses require a growth medium containing
living cell therefore cannot be cultured in any synthetic
medium. Viruses are transmitted from one organism to another
not only by biological vectors but also by mechanical vectors.
Mechanical vector like an arthropod vector which transmit
an infective organism from one host to another but it is not
essential to the life of cycle of the parasite.
187. (a) Mite, Spider and Scorpion belong to the category of
Arachnids, while Crabs belong to the category of
crustaceans.
Biology E49
188. (b) Smallpox is the only disease eradicated from India.
189. (a) Deficiency of vitamin C causes Scurvy, disease of
gums. Deficiency of vitamin D causes Rickets (disease of
bones) and Deficiency of Vitamin A causes night blindness,
disease of eyes.
190. (c) Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic
depression in endothermsis characterized by low body
temperature, slow breathing and heart rate, and low metabolic
rate.It is found in Bat ,bear and rodents etc.
191. (d) H1N1 flu is also known as swine flu. The cause of
swine flu is an influenza A virus type designated as H1N
1.
192. (d) (i) A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates
only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can
infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to
microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi .
(ii) According to the type of the host they infect, viruses
are classified mainly into the following four types:
(a) Plant viruses including algal viruses-RNA/DNA
(b) Animal viruses including human viruses-DNA/
RNA
(c) Fungal viruses(Mycoviruses)-ds RNA
(d) Bacterial viruses (Bacteriophages) including
cyanophages-DN
Hence answer “(d)”.
193. (c) Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are spread through
a common vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. So first
statement is right. Although Zika virus is primarily
transmitted through mosquitoes, it can also be sexually
transmitted as well. So second statement is also right.
194. (d) Birds (#1) moving through crops can carry pathogens
from the infected plant to other plans. Woodpeckers carry
spores of tree pathogens. Some plant pathogenic bacteria
are carried to short distance by wind (#4). In some places,
rain seems to be more important than insects in
disseminating the fire blight bacteria, by its washing or
splattering effect of rain. (#3). There is only Option D
w h e r e 1 , 3 a n d 4 a r e t o g e t h e r . S o , " d " h a s t o b e t h e
correct option.
195. (d) As per NIOS biology page 159 & 176: Thorn is not
a ‘leaf modification’, it is an ‘aerial modification of stem’.
“Spine” is a leaf modification to protect the plant and help
in reducing transpiration. So by elimination Answer should
‘B’. However, Goh Cheng Leong Page 136 mentioned that
“Desert plants have few or no leaves, and the foliage is
either waxy, leathery, hairy or needle shaped to reduce
water loss through transpiration. Some of them are entirely
leafless, with pricks or thrones.” So accordingly Answershould be D. Thus, experts were divided between a or d.
UPSC has kept ‘D’ as the official answer.
196. (d)
· Cobras, the pythons, the keelbacks don’t lay eggs so
they’re called ‘viviparous’ as bring out live young. So, #4
is right. Answer could be b, c or d, in all these options, #2 is
common so we’ve to accept ‘Some species of fish are
herbivores’ are true without verification.
·Depending on the species, sea turtles may be
carnivorous (meat eating), herbivorous (plant eating), or
omnivorous (eating both meat and plants). So #1 is right
and by elimination we are left with answer d: all statements
are correct.
197. ( b ) 2018-Dec the Hindu: Overuse and misuse of
antimicrobial agents is the single most important cause of
development of resistance. They are also used
indiscriminately as growth promoters in animals or used to
prevent diseases in healthy animals. The antibiotics used
in livestock are ingested by humans when they consume
food.The transfer of resistant bacteria to humans by farm
animals was first noted more than 35 years ago. (says
American medical journal) . So, #2 & #3 are right this
eliminates A and C. Because they don’t contain 2 or
3. So,
we are at 50:50 between B or D. As per the official UPSC
Answerkey, correct answer is “b”.
198. (b) NCERT Class12 Biology page 152: Recombinant DNA
technology has allowed the production V accines on large
scale production. e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from
yeast. That means Option b is wrong, and we are asked to
find wrong option.
199. (d)
•2017’s the Hindu article says that CRISPR genome
editing tool can be used for accomplishing statement#
1.
•2020-May: Asia Times says that #3 was done in
China. So, #3 is correct, Weare left with the answer “d”.
•Recall that in 2018 too, UPSC had asked a question
from CRISPR genome editing Technology but it was a
much simpler one liner question.
200. (b)
•This vaccine is 80% effective against meningitis,
sepsis and pneumonia So #1 is right.
•Pneumococcal b conjugate vaccines have reduced
the burden of antibiotic-resistant bacterial disease
globally says the Lancet study-report 2017 So #2 is right.
•Various research papers have indicated that vaccine
may cause certain side effects and allergic reactions so,
#3 is wrong. Accordingly , Answer is b

in maintaining the structure of an ecological community
and whose impact in the community is greater than would
be expected based on its relative abundance or total biomass.
3. (a) Only crocodile is kept in the Red book or endangered
species list.
4. (b) The protocol was initially adopted on 11th December
1997. But it entered into force on 16th February 2005, after
Kyoto, Japan. So, it is called Kyoto protocol.
Kyoto protocol deals with reducing the green house gases
emission to a level at least 5% below 1990 level. Methane is
more effective or harmful green house gas than carbon
dioxide.
5. (c) The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one
of the Flexible Mechanisms defined in the Kyoto Protocol
(IPCC, 2007) that provides for emissions reduction
projects which generate Certified Emission Reduction
units which may be traded in emissions trading schemes.
The CDM is defined in Article 12 of the Protocol and is
intended to meet two objectives: (1) to assist parties not
included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development
and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change(UNFCCC), which is to prevent dangerous climate
change; and (2) to assist parties included in Annex I in
achieving compliance with their quantified emission
limitation and reduction commitments (greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission caps).

8. (b) The Kyoto Protocol invented the concept of carbon
emissions trading, whereby carbon credits were a "flexibility
mechanism". Under this flexibility mechanism Annex 1
(developed countries) could use the carbon credits to meet
their emission reduction commitments.
A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate
or permit representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon
dioxide or the mass of another greenhouse gas with a carbon
dioxide (tCO2e) equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide.
9. (c) Methane and nitrous oxide are the two green house

13. (d) Biomagnification is the phenomenon of increasing
concentration of compound in the tissue of organism, as
the compound passes up a food chain, usually as a result of
food intake. In this case, the concentration of compound
will increase with increasing the tropic level. Biomagnifying
pollutants which increases in concentration from producers
®Primary consumers ®Secondary consumers ®
Tertiary consumers ® Top consumer. Hawk is the top
consumer, so the pesticide concentration will be highest in
Hawk.

16. (a) Global warming is the increase in the average
temperature of Earth's near-surface air and oceans by
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, which result
from human activity such as the burning of fossil fuel and
deforestation. Climate change mitigation is action to
decrease the potential effects of global warming. At a time
rate of mitigation is less in India because appropriate
technologies are limited and costly . Moreover India don't
have huge funds required for research and development in
that area.
17. (d) Ambient temperature simply means "the temperature
of the surroundings" and will be the same as room
temperature. Indoor the common range is 20°C (68°F) to
27°C (80 °F). Similarly, ambient pressure on an object is the
pressure of the surrounding medium, such as a gas or liquid,
which comes into contact with the object. The soot, sulphur
hexaflouride, and water vapour all three can be found at
ambient atmosphere which corresponds to ambient
temperature and pressure, and subsequently warming up
of atmosphere.

19. (d) Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'caps' or quotas for
Greenhouse gases for the developed Annex 1 countries are
known as Assigned Amounts and are listed in Annex B.
The quantity of the initial assigned amount is denominated
in individual units, called Assigned amount units (AAUs),
each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric
tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered
into the country's national registry .
20. (c) Since CO2 is heavier than air, it sinks in ocean than
moving up. Also, during winter, it is observed that CO2 is
trapped in ice caps.
21. (b) Upwelling brings nutrient-rich water towards the ocean
surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-depleted
surface water. This is to do with the phytoplankton’s and
nothing to do with the decomposer microorganisms.
22. (b) The nitric acid in polar stratospheric clouds reacts with
CFCs to form chlorine, which catalyzes the photochemical

24. (c) To qualify as a hotspot, a region must meet two strict
criteria: it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular
plants (>
0.5 percent of the world’s total) as endemics, and
it has to have lost at least 70 percent of its original habitat.
So we choose Species richness as well as Endemism. Along
with this Threat perception is necessary to take , because it
makes the base of this concept. Adaptation of flora is an
arbitrary option, Ethno-botanical importance does nothing
with the Biodiversity Hotspot selection criteria, vegetation
Density is also discarded.
25. (b) Himalayas and its adjoining areas are marked as a
confluence of several biogeographical realms. It has varity
of forest type and is rich in zoo-biogeographic region.
26. (d) Algae multiply rapidly when nutrients are present. So,
discharge of nutrients favour algae and subsequently algal
bloom growth from estuaries to sea. The run off from the
land during the monsoon bring salts which favours the
growth of algae. Upwelling of the sea water brings the
nutrients to top level leading to rapid algae multiplication.
27. (c) Photosynthesis by plants removes about 120 billion
tons of carbon from the air per year, but plant decomposition
returns about the same amount. When the organic matter is
oxidized through respiration, the reverse of photosynthesis
takes place. Respiration releases CO2 into the atmosphere.
Respiration and photosynthesis occur at nearly equal rates
over one year. V olcanic eruptions and metamorphism release
gases into the atmosphere. V olcanic gases are primarily water
vapor, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide.

(i) A Net metering is a billing mechanism that credits
solar energy system owners for the electricity they add to
the grid. Net metering allows residential and commercial
customers who generate their own electricity from solar
power to feed electricity they do not use back into the grid.
(ii) Under Net-metering system, Customer installs a solar
or windpower plant on his premise, gets it grid-connected
with the electricity distribution company (DISCOM) Hence
(a) is the apt choice.
110. (d)
(i) The Gadgil Commission was an environmental
research commission appointed by the Ministry of
Environment and Forests of India. The Commission

(i) National Ganga River Basin Authority
(NGRBA) is a financing, planning, implementing, monitor-
ing and coordinating authority for the Ganges River, func-
tioning under the water resource ministry of India. The mis-
sion of the organisation is to spearhead the river conserva-
tion efforts at the national level.
(ii) In 2014, UPSC asked similar question, where one of
the statement was- “PM is chairman of NGRBA”. That
statement was right as per India Yearbook
2014. Therefore,
here statement 3 is wrong, CM can’t be the chairman of
NGRBA. By elimination, we reach answer (a).
114. (a) These camels can swim up to three kilometers into the
sea in search of mangroves-So, 1 and 2 are correct.Most
families in Jatt and Rabari communities of Kachchh, are
traditional rearers of Kharai camels. So, third statement also
correct.
Kharai camels found in the Kutch region are very unique.
They can can swim through deep sea waters and it feeds on
mangroves and other saline plants. The breeders have
meticulously followed the traditional grazing pattern in the
coastal districts. They do not provide special housing or
shelter to the camels.Given the breed’s ability to survive
both on land and sea, the Kharai camel is one of the most
preferred choices of graziers in the arid coastal region of
Kachchh. People consume its milk, while male calves are
sold for economic returns (females are not sold because
they are considered sacred). A male calf fetches anywhere
between Rs. 6,000 and Rs.14,000, says Ramesh Bhatti of
Sahjeevan, an NGO working on livelihood issues of
graziers in Kachchh. It can be domesticated also – so its
not wild. They are reared in four blocks of Abdasa, Bundra,
Lakhpat and Bachau of Gujarat.

(i) Pterocarpus santalinus , with the common names Red
Sanders, Red Sandalwood, and saunderswood, is a species
of Pterocarpus endemic to the southern Eastern Ghats
mountain range of South India. This tree is valued for the
rich red color of its wood. The wood is not aromatic.
(ii) It was in national media during April 2015, when
Andhra Pradesh police killed 20 Red Sander smugglers in
an encounter. So first statement is right.
(iii) Red Sanders is associated with Tropical dry
deciduous forest, as per environment ministry website,
Hence 2nd statement wrong.
117. (b) National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is
planning to implement a new computerized tiger
monitoring protocol in all tiger reserves of the country
known as Monitoring System for Tiger, Intensive
Patrolling and Ecological Status (MSTrIPES).
118. (b) Even if you eliminate Corbett (Uttrakhand) and
Mudumalai (Tamil Nadu) for climatic reasons for Lion
relocation, still you're left with Sariska (Rajasthan). Sariska
being a tiger reserve, would sound unfit for lion
immigration. So by elimination answer would be "B". and
Indianexpress report confirm it.
119. (a) Tiger is given as Schedule I animal. So "A" is correct.
120. (d) The schedule 5 vermin- crow, fruitbat, mice and rat
can be killed. Since the animals given in above MCQ are
outside that list hence answer is "D".
121. (b) Gharials are river dwelling fish-eaters and their only
viable population is in the Chambal Sanctuary. So "B"
should be the answer.
122. (a) NCERT Class 11: India- Physical Geography.
A. Page 17: The Eastern and Western Ghats Meet at
Nilgiri hills.
B. Page 16: Nilgiri hills are in Karnataka and Tamilnadu.
Now, If there is a place serving as Ecological link
between Eastern and Western Ghats, then most likely it
ought to be in Tamil Nadu, than in Karnataka, because of
the location. "A" is the most fitting answer because it's
located in Tamil Nadu.
123. (b) First statement is wrong because TRAFFIC is joint
program of WWF and IUCN and Second statement is
correct because verbatim given in the organization's
official page.
124. (c) Statement 1 is right (by common knowledge) but for
the sake of reference- NCERT Class 12 biology page 30!
This eliminates "B". Second statement should be wrong
because of the extreme word "drastic". This eliminates
"D". Besides I'm unable to find any specific reference that
mentions linkage between butterfly population vs fungus
infection. Birds and spiders tend to prey on butterflies (by
common knowledge) so statement 3 is a possible
outcome.
H ence answ er "C": 1 and 3 o nly .
125. (c) NCERT Class 11 Chemistry: Ch. 14-Environmental
Chemistry, page 407
The amount of oxygen required by bacteria to break down
the organic matter present in a certain volume of a sample
of water, is called Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).T h e a m o u n t o f B O D i n t h e w a t e r i s a m e a s u r e o f t h e
amount of organic material in the water, in terms of how
much oxygen will be required to break it down biologically.
Clean water would have BOD value of less than 5 ppm
whereas highly polluted water could have a BOD value of
17 ppm or more.
126. (c) Biosparging is an in-Situ Bioremediation techniques
in which we inject the air under pressure below the water
table to enhance the rate of biological degradation of
contaminants by naturally occurring bacteria. Hence
statement 1 is right. In Google Scholar search engine is
filled with academic papers on genetic engineering
approaches to bioremediation. Hence 3 is also right. But
not all compounds are susceptible to rapid and complete
biodegradation, and bioremediation often takes longer
time than other treatment processes. So, second statement
unlikely to be correct. Hence, answer "C" 1 and 3 only.
127. (d) Carbon sequestration may be carried out by pumping
carbon into carbon sinks of two types:
A. Natural sinks- ocean, forest, soil etc.
B. Artificial sink- depleted oil reserve, unminable mines.
So statement 1 and 2 are correct.
And deep Saline Formations infact have highest
capacity f o r this. So acco rdingly , answ er is "D".
128. (b) US National Research Council report on Algal
Biofuel (2012) observed that
1. algae and cyanobacteria biomass production in the
U.S. desert Southwest could be perceived as a good use
of low-value land by some, but as an intrusion into pristine
land by others. Similarly, the use of genetically modified
organisms in production systems could affect social
acceptability. So this is social concern. [and it also proves
statement #1 wrong.]
2. Open Algal ponds will attract insect larvae invasion
and affect predator-prey balance. This is ecological
concern. Hence Statement 3 is right.
3. And the report discussed challenges production and
technology. Hence answer 2 and
3.
129. (a) As per their organizations' "About us" page:
EuropeAid (DG for International Cooperation and
Development) drives and oversees the overall

By elimination we are left with "A".
130. (b) As per the timeline given on their official "About us"
page: CCAC was formed in 2012 by UNEP and Ghana,
Bangladesh etc. countries. So first statement is
wrong.Second statement is right- they focus on Short Lived
Climate Pollutants such as methane, black carbon and
hydrofluorocarbons.
131. (b) This plant is a native of Mexico, and spread throughout
India It's an aggressive colonizer, common weed of
wastelands, scrublands and degraded forests. Since it's
mention under the head of invasive alien species so it'd
reduce biodiversity in the area, Hence Option (B)
132. (a) Studies have shown that increased concentrations of

1. (a) All the statements about the Indian satellite given in
the question are correct.

2. (c) The surface velocity of rotation varies from point to
point on the Earth. It is about 1600 km per hour or about 460
meters in a second near the equator. The velocity gradually
reduces as we move to the poles and it is practically zero
there. A satellite launched from the sites near the equator
towards the east direction will get an initial boost equal to
the velocity of Earth surface. This is similar to an athlete
circling round and round before throwing a discus or a shot
put. The initial boost helps in cutting down the cost of
rockets used to launch the satellites. This is the major reason
for launching satellites in the east ward direction. But this
benefit can be taken only for such satellites which are placed
in geo-stationary orbit or which circle the Earth parallel to
the equator.

As either of T or P can reside on the ground floor, so to
exactly find who resides on the ground floor, given
statements are insufficient.

43. (a) S e t 12345
Balls 1 1 1 1 1
Now, any further removal of balls from any set will
ensure that removed ball is of the same colour as one of the
already removed balls, thus constituting a pair of the
removed balls of the same colour.
S e t 12345
Balls 1+1 1 1 1 1
Hence, minimum no. of removed balls = 6

44. (b) Let the no. of only tea takers be x, number of only coffee
takers be y and number of both tea and coffee takers be z.
Now, x + z = 2y ....(i)
y + z = 2x ....(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get,
x = y = z \x + y + z = z + z + z = 3z
Thus, statement 1 is not correct.
Also, x + y = z + z = 2z
Thus, statement 2 is correct.

45. (d) Statement 1 is correct as it clearly shows that 1, 2, 5
and 6 are on the sides of 4 and 1 is opposite. Statement 2 is
correct on the same lines. 3 is opposite 
4. 3 is correct as I &
IV clearly tells that 4 is opposite 
3. All the three statementsregarding the figure given in the question are correct. Hence,
the answer is (d).

182. (c) The passage clearly talks about the role Mangroves
play in some of the coastal food chains. Other food chains
- with or without Mangroves-might exist but they are not
mentioned in the passage. So (c) is correct. The passage
does not say that no food chain is possible without
Mangroves so (a) is wrong. (b) is also wrong as the passage
does not talk about Mangroves being an essential
component of all marine ecosystems. Further (d) is also
wrong for the same reasoning as the passage does not talk
about the composition of marine flora and fauna.

183. (d) (a) is wrong because the sentence says that liberty

 = 519000 – 19000100´
 = 19000 – 950 = 18050
So, firm needs one extra day other than 19 days to
complete the order.
\ Firm will complete the order in 20 days.

285. (b) From statement s2, (p + q) is an odd integers.
i.e., p and q are not either even or odd simultaneously.
so, p and q are even and odd respectively and
vice-versa.
Hence, p.q is always odd is incorrect. p.q is always even.

Between 2009 and 2015:
Number of non-leap year = 5 = 5 odd days
Number of Leap year = 1 = 2 odd days
Hence, 2015 have same calendar as 
2009.

287. (b) 5th monday of April will fall on 29th or 30th April.
again 5th thursday of November will fall on 29th or 30th
November.
When 29th April is Monday.
then, Number of days between 29th April and 29th
November = 214 days
= 30 weeks + 4 days.
thus 29th of November would be Friday.
But 29th November is thursday, hence, 30th April is
Monday.
Now, Number of days between 29th November and 20th
december = 21 days. = 3 weeks
Hence, 20th december is Thursday.

We get that D is oldest one among the given four
persons.
From S3 : A > B, B is younger than A.
From S1 and S3, we get that,

B is the youngest.

298. (c) From S1 : R > P and Q
From S2 : R > S , as S is not the largest one
From S1 and S2, R > P, Q and S
Hence, R is the largest.
Thus, both statements S1 and S2 together are sufficient
to answer the question.

299. (c) The missing letter's that complete the series are :

So, R must is a female and daughter-in-law of Q. Q is
the wife of P . T is an unmarried brother of P. U is
unmarried sister of S.

302. (c) Number of days between 12th January to 12th July in a
leap year.
= 19 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 12 = 182 = 26 weeks
Hence, 12th July will be same as 12th January in a leap
year. So, it will be Sunday.

Total number of ways = 4 + 5 + 5 = 14

12. (c) Since, answers of no. two examinees are identical, so
first item in List-A can be matched with any of the 5 items in
List-B. It can be done in 5 ways. Similarly , 2nd item in List-A
can be matched with any of the remaining 4 items in List-B.
It can be done in 4 ways.
Continuing in the same way ,
No of ways of arranging the items = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1=120
Now, in this arrangement there is one such arrangement,

So now there are (6 – 2 + 1) = 5 players
These 5 players can be arranged in 5! ways and Ajit and
Mukerjee can be arranged among themselves in 2! ways.
Thus, no of ways, when Ajit and Mukerjee are always
together = 5 ! × 2!
Hence, no of ways when they are never together
= T o tal no o f w ay s – no o f w ay s w he n the y are alw ay s

There can be two cases:
Case (I) : When x row contains 6 balls:
Then the 2 balls can be arranged in y row in 6P2 ways = 15
or the 2 balls can be arranged in any of the 4 two box row in
4 ways.
So, no of ways, when x contains 6 balls = 15 + 4 = 
19.
Case (II) : Similarly , no. of ways, when y row contains 6
balls = 19
As, either of case (I) or case (II) is possible,
Hence, total no. of ways = 19 + 19 = 38

28. (c) Suppose three people have been given a, b and c
number of items.
Then, a × b × c = 30
Now, There can be 5 cases :
Case I : When one of them is given 30 items and rest two 1
item each.
So, number of ways for (30 × 1 × 1) = 3!32!=
(As two of them have same number of items)
Case II : Similarly, number of ways for (10 × 3 × 1) = 3! = 6
Case III : Number of ways for (15 × 2 × 1) = 3! = 6
Case IV : Number of ways for (6 × 5 × 1) = 3! = 6
Case V : Number of ways for (5 × 3 × 2) = 3! = 6
Here, either of these 5 cases are possible.
Hence, total number of ways = 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 27

29. (b) There can be five cases :
Case I : First triangle can have 5 balls and rest three 1 each.
So, number of ways for (5, 1, 1, 1) = 4!
3!= 4
(Q Three triangles are having same number of balls)
Case II : Number of ways for (4, 2, 1, 1) = 4!
2! = 12
(Q Two triangles are having same number of balls)

31. (c) These can be two cases :
Case I-One box contain 3 balls and rest two
Contains 1 ball each.
Case II-One box contain 1 ball and rest two
Contains 2 balls each.
Case 1 : Number of ways = 5C3 × 2C1 × 1C1 = 20
Now, these 3 boxes can be arranged in 3!
2!among themselves,
as two of them contains similar number of balls.
So, number of ways = 3!20 602!´=
Case II : Number of ways = 5C1 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 30
Also, these 3 boxes can be arranged among themselves in
3!
2!, as two of them contains similar number of balls.
Thus, number of ways = 3!30 902!´=
Now, either of case (I) or case (II) is possible,
Hence, total number of ways = 60 + 90 = 150

32. (c) Out of the given letters in the word SACHIN, S is the
last letter in the alphabetical order to start a word. If the
word starts with A, then A can be kept fixed and the remaining
letters can be arranged in 5! ways.
Similarly, number of words starting with C = 5!
Number of words starting with H = 5!
Number of words starting with I = 5!
Number of words starting with N = 5!
Now, when the word starts with S, then SACHIN is the first
word in the alphabetical order to follow up.
So, Position of the word SACHIN = 5 (5!) + 1 = 601

33. (c) There can be 3 cases :
I. When one dice shows 
2.
II. When two dice shows 
2.
III. When three dices shows 
2.
Case I : The dice which shows 2 can be selected out of the
3 dices in 3C1 ways.
Remaining 2 dices can have any 5 numbers except 
2. So
number of ways for them = 5C1 each, so no of ways when
one dice shows 2 = 3C1 × 5C1 × 5C
1.
Case II : Two dices, showing 2 can be selected out of the 3
dices in 3C2 ways and the rest one can have any 5 numbers
except 2, so number of ways for the remaining 1 dice = 
5.

Topicwise Solved Papers F84
So, number of ways, when two dices show 2
= 3C2 × 5
Case III : When three dices show 2 then these can be selected
in 3C3 ways.
So, number of ways, when three dices show 2 = 3C3 = 1
As, either of these three cases are possible.
Hence, total number of ways
= (3 × 5 × 5) + (3 × 5) + 1 = 91

There can be 3 cases :
Case I: When balls lie along the straight horizontal line.
3 balls can be put in any of the 4 boxes along the horizontal
row in 4C3 ways.
Now, since there are 3 rows, so number of ways for case I
= 4C3 × 3 = 12
Case II : When balls lie along the vertical straight line 3
balls can be put in any of the 3 boxes along the vertical row
in 3C3 ways.
Now, as there are 4 vertical rows, so number of ways for
Case II = 3C3 × 4 = 4
Case III : Balls lie along the 2 diagonal lines towards the left
and 2 diagonal lines towards the right.
Number of ways = 2 + 2 = 4
Number of ways, when balls lie along the line = 12 + 4 + 4
 = 20
Number of ways when balls don't lie along the line = Total
number of ways – number of ways when balls lie along the
line. = 220 – 20 = 
200.

35. (c) Total number of arrangements, when any 3 boys are
selected out of 5 = 5C
3. Now, when groups contains both C
and D, then their selection is fixed and the remaining 1 boy
can be selected out of the remaining 3 boys. It can be done
in 3C1 ways.
So, number of groups, when none contains both C and D
= total number of arrangements-number of arrangements
when group contains both C and D
= 5C3 – 3C1= 10 – 3 = 7

36. (b) Let us take books A and B as one i.e., they are always
continuous.
Now, number of books = 4 – 2 + 1 = 3
These three books can be arranged in 3! ways and also A
and B can be arranged in 2 ways among themselves.
So, number of ways when books A and B are always
continuous = 2 × 3!
Total number of ways of arrangement of A, B, C and D = 4!
Hence, number of ways when A and B are never continuous
= Total number of ways – number of ways when A and B
always continuous = 4! – 2 × 3! = 12

37. (c) Suppose any particular student is always selected.
Now, remaining 2 students are to be selected out of the
remaining 5 students.
It can be done in 5C2 ways = 5!102! 3!=´

38. (d) There can be two cases :
Case I : When 1 row contains 3 balls and rest two contains
1 ball each.Now, the row which contains 3 balls can be selected out of
the 3 rows in 3C1 ways and in this row number of ways of
arrangement = 3C
3. In other two rows, number of ways of
arrangement in each = 3C
1.
Thus, number of ways for case I = 3C1 × 3C3 × 3C1 × 3C1
 = 3 × 1 × 3 × 3 = 27
Case II : When 1 row contains 1 ball and rest two rows
contain 2 balls each.
This row, containing 1 ball can be selected in 3C1 ways and
number of ways of arrangement in this row = 3C
1. In other
two rows, containing 2 balls each, number of ways of
arrangement in each = 3C
2.
Thus, number of ways for case II = 3C1 × 3C1 × 3C2 × 3C2
= 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81
As, either of these two cases are possible, hence total
number of ways = case I or case II = 27 + 81 = 
108.

39. (a) As there are 6 letters and envelopes, so if exactly 5 are
into correctly addressed envelopes, then the remaining 1 will
automatically be placed in the correctly addressed envelope.
Thus, the probability that exactly 5 go into the correctly
addressed envelope is zero.

40. (c) Let us start with Red colour
Where, R = Red, B = Black, W = White
R B RW
R W RB
RBRB
RWRW
R BWR
RW BR
RBBR
RW WR
There are eight such arrangements, if we start with Red ball.
Similarly, there are 8 arrangements, if we start with black or
white ball.
Hence, No. of arrangements = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24

41. (b) No. of different sums of money = any 1 coin at a time +
any 2 coins + any 3 coins it all 4 coins
= 4C1 + 4C2 + 4C3 + 4C4
= 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15

42. (a) Case I : When 4 is at the hundredth place.
 Remaining two places can be filled through any
of the numbers 0 to 9 except 4 in 9 ways.
So, no of ways = 1 × 9 × 9 = 81
Case II : When 4 is at the units or tens place and 3 is at the
hundredth place. Here, 4 is at the units place, then tens
place can be filled through any of the numbers 0 to 9 except
4 in 9 ways or else if 4 is at the tens place, then units place
can be filled in 9 ways.
So, no of ways = 1 × (9 + 9) = 1 × 18 = 18
Here, either case I or case II is possible. Hence, total no. of
ways = 81 + 18 = 99

43. (d) Any 3 digits out of 9 can be selected in 9C3 ways.
Now, these three digits can be arranged among themselves
in ascending order in only 1 way .
Hence, total no. of ways = 9C3 × 1 = 84

44. (c) Since in 221 games each boy plays exactly one game
with each girl,


Permutation, Combination & Probability F85
So, mn = 221 (1)
as, m > n > 1, so only m = 17 and n = 13 satisfies (1)
\ Total no of students = m + n = 17 + 13 = 30
Number of games in which both players are girls
= 13C2 = 78

45. (d) Each question can be answered in 2 ways.
Hence, total no. of sequences = 2 × 2 × ........ 10 times

46. (b) Different sums of money can be formed by taking one,
two, three and all the four notes together.
No. of different sums= 4C1 + 4C2 + 4C3 + 4C4

47. (d) First person can shake hand with the other 9 i.e, in 9
ways. Second person can shake hand with the remaining 8
persons and so on.
\ total no. of hands shaked = 9 + 8 + ....... + 2 + 1

48. (b) Take, A and B to be always together as a single entity .
Now, total no. of children = 4 – 2 + 1 = 3
These can be arranged in 3! ways and A, B can be arranged
among themselves in 2! ways.
Hence, no. of arrangements such that A and B are always
together = 3! × 2! = 3 × 2 × 2 = 12

49. (b) Given, n (U) = 100
Number of students who play cricket = 60
i.e. n(C) = 60
Number of students who play football = 30
i.e. n(F) = 30
Number of students who play both the games = 10
i.e. n(C Ç F) = 10
To find : n(C¢Ç F¢) = ?
we kn ow,
n(C È F) = n(C) + n(F) – n(C Ç F)
 = 60 + 30 –10 = 80
n(C¢ Ç F¢) = n(C È F)¢ = n(U) – n(C È F)
 = 100 – 80 = 20

Distance travelled by the 2nd lady in one hour
=v × 1 = 6 km

11. (a) According to question relative speed of the car with
respect to the bus

12. (b) Length of train = 150 m
Speed of train = 90 km/h = 59018´ = 25 m/s
Length of bridge = 200 m
To cross the bridge, the train has to travel a distance equal
to sum of the length of bridge and the length of train.
Total distance to be covered = 150 + 200 = 350 m
Time taken = Distance
Speed = 350

Walking time = 345 – 
112.5 =

15. (b) Distance travelled by X upto 11 a.m. = Distance
travelled by X upto 10 a.m. = 60 × 1 = 60 km.
Distance travelled by Y upto 11 a.m. = 2 × 60 = 120
Now, at 11 a.m., distance between X and Y
= 700 – (120 + 60) = 520 km.hr.
Relative speed of X with respect to Y
= 60 – (–60) = 120 km/hr.
Now, they will cross each other, when they cover a distance
of 520 km with a relative speed of 120 km/hr after 11 a.m.
Time taken after 11 a.m. = 520
120= 13603´ min
 = 260 min = 4 hr. 20 min.
\ Time = 11 + 4 hr. 20 min = 3:20 p.m.

16. (b) Total time for which A and B travel
= 5 hr 30 min = 152hrs (from 7 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.)
Distance travelled by A in 152hours = 3 × 11/2 = 
16.5 km
Distance traveled by B in 152hours = 
2.5× 11/2 = 
13.75km
Therefore in 152hours, difference in distance travelled by A
and B is (
16.5 – 
13.75) km, i.e. 
2.75 km. The total extra distance
need to be travelled by one in order to cross the other by at
least once.
Length of path around the field = perimeter of rectangle
= 2(l + b) = 2(400 + 300) = 1400 m = 
1.4 km
A might cross B more than once, for that they may need at
least 
1.4 × 2 = 
2.8 km difference between themselves, but the
difference is 
2.75 km. Hence, they will cross each other only

each other 5 times in an hour and 2 times in half an hour.
Hence, they cross each other 7 times before 9 : 30 a.m.

43. (a) Here, A takes the shortest time to cross the bridge i.e.
1 min. And, D takes 10 min, C takes 7 min and B takes 2

1. A + B crossing and A returning : (2 + 1) min

2. A + C crossing and A returning : (7 + 1) min

3. A + D crossing and A returning : (10 + 1) min

is not too little. Health problems may come under the others
category . Here, family clearly manages to meet all the
expenses out of the income.

2. (a) For I and III, traffic volume is same. Since, Average
Noise level is same for I and III and % of Heavy vehicles
differs for I and III, so clearly % of Heavy vehicles affects
the noise pollution level.

3. (d) A s g i v e n i n t h e G r a p h , c l e a r l y Q a t t a i n s 1 0 0 ° C

average investment by investor 1 is best compare to others.

5. (b) According to the data showing revenues expenditure
of Indian Government, it can be said that the Indian economy
is in poor shape due to it’s increasing debt payments. Due
to the burden of debt payments there remains little scope to
utilize this money for any other purpose.

6. (c) Sales in year 1979 = 320, 000
Sales in year 1981 = 420,000
Thus the required difference = 420,000 – 320,000
 = ` 100,000

10. (b) The inflation rate in spain is less than that in Belgium
and Britain. In graph Italy and France seem to have almost
identical unemployment.

11. (a) From the given table, we see that record production of
rice & wheat has been in 1994-95 and that are 
81.81 M tonnes
and 
65.77 M tonnes respectively. Also from 1980 to 1995
production seems to have steadity increase.

12. (b) From the graph, it can be seen that yield rate is not
zero at B and C. With no fertilizer input, yield is 
20. Yield is
clearly minimum at D, i.e., 
8. At C, yield is 20 and it is neither
maximum nor minimum. So clearly option 3 and 4 are correct.

16. (c) Declining population means greater number of death
rate i.e. narrower upper part and lower number of birth rate
i.e. narrower base. These conditions are satisfied by
‘pyramids C’.

17. (d) Exponential growth means increase exponentially . Only
graph D shows the exponential growth of population during
year 1800-
2000.

18. (d)Populations of both towns A and B are not given,
hence, no inference can be drawn.

19. (b) The sum of percentage of patients in town A is 100,
hence there is no any patient with more than one disease.

20. (d) Distance = time ´ speed, here train B is faster than
train A, hence Train B will cover more distance than train A.

21. (a) Incubation phase means the time between somebody
being infected with a diseases in graph part A shows that
phase.

22. (b) Region B clearly shows the symptoms of infection.

23. (c) Though relief began from region C but only region E
indicates effective relief.

24. (b) Since x axis shows the distance and y axis shows the
time, hence lower graph will show faster athlete and higher
graph will show slower athlete. Height of A's graph is the
lowest, hence, the race was won by A. Height of B's graph
is lower than A's graph up to 25 km, hence B was running
faster than A up to 25 km. The height of C's graph is the
lowest from the beginning, hence he run very fastly from
the beginning, Hence statement 3 is not correct.

If a student scores 74 marks in each of the four tests, his
performance would be the best comparatively in test II
because there would be less numbers of the students in
this range in test II only .

26. (d) Time taken to finish a work is inversely proportional to
the number of persons working at it.
\More persons then less is the time taken to finish a

42. (d) According to the given graph, during mid of the
August, actual progress was more than expected progress.

43. (d) According to the graph, population growth rate shows
no trend.

44. (d) After 2005 birth rate and population growth has no
change.

45. (c) From the two given graphs, we got that slopes of two
graphs are same.

46. (a) Manufacturing cost of 1000 pieces = 600000
Cost of 1 piece when 1000 pieces manufactured
=600000
1000= 600
Selling price of 1 piece when 1000 pieces manufactured = 400
Manufacturing cost of 2000 pieces = 700000
Cost of 1 piece when 2000 pieces manufactured
=700000
2000= 350
Selling price of 1 piece when 2000 pieces manufactured = 350
Hence, required number of pieces = 2000

1. In country B, over the last two and a half decades
(2025 to 2050), the sum of the number of people aged less
than 15 years and more than 64 years is slightly increased
but number of people aged from 15 to 64 years increased
tremendeously. Therefore dependency radio of country B
has decreased over the last two and half decades.

2. By the end of next two and a half decades (i.e. 2075),
sum of the number of people aged less than 15 years and
more than 64 years of country A is more than that of country
B where as number of people of aged from 15 to 64 years of
country A is less than that of country B.
Hence by the end of next two and a half decades, the depen-
dency ratio of country A will be more than that of country B.

3. In the next two decades (i.e. 2050-2070), graph of work-
force (i.e. population of aged from 15 years to 64 years) of
country A is going lower and that of country B is going
higher.
Therefore, in the next two decades, the work-force relative
to its total population will increase in country B as compared
to country A.

48. (d) Repo rate and reverse repo rate is directly related to
Anti-inflationary stance
49. (c) The most logical and rational inference is Higher per
capita income is associated with higher T ele-density and
high GDP does not ensure higher T ele-density .

50. (d) T h e r e ar e m an y p o i n t s r e lat e d t o G DP o f st at e an d

51. (a)

1. Corporate tax (……) and personal tax (-----) are direct
taxes. From graph it is clear that corporate tax is increasing
tremendeously whereas personal tax increased slightly.
Exercise ( ), customs ( ) and service tax ( ) are
indirect taxes. From the graph, it is clear that exercise and
customs decreased tremendeously whereas service tax is
increased.
Therefore, during the given period, the revenue from direct
taxes as percentage of gross tax revenue has increased
while that of indirect taxes decreased.

2. From the graph, it is clear that exercise duty is over all
decreased tremendeously . But after 2010, exercise duty
increases slightly . This traineds of exercise duty has many
reasons. One of then may be decreasing rate of exercise
duty to promote manufacturing sector thats why after 2010
exercise duty increases slightly.

52. (c) Total import of sheet steel in first three months
 = 40 + 37 + 36 = 113
Total import of coil steel in first three months
= 30 + 31 + 33 = 94
Required velue = 113 – 94 = 
19.

53. (c) Total sheet steel important over six months period
= 40 + 37 + 36 + 36 + 34 + 34 = 217
Total velue = 217 × 256 = 55552 » 55550

54. (b) T otal sheet steel imported in first three months
= 40 + 37 + 36 =113
Total scrap steel imported in first three months
= 32 + 34 + 32 = 98
Required ratio = 113 : 98 =

passage only.
PASSAGE
Now India's children have a right-to receive at least eight years of
education, the gnawing question is whether it will remain on paper
or become a reality . One hardly needs a reminder that this right is
different from the others enshrined in the Constitution, that the
beneficiary – a six year old child cannot demand it, nor can she or
he fight a legal battle when the right is denied or violated. In all
cases, it is the adult society which must act on behalf of the child.
In another peculiarity, where a child's right to education is denied,
no compensation offered later can be adequate or relevant. This
is so because childhood does not last. If a legal battle fought on
behalf of a child is eventually won, it may be of little use to the
boy or girl because the opportunity missed at school during
childhood cannot serve the same purpose later in life. This may
be painfully true for girls because our society permits them only
a short childhood, if at all. The Right to Education (RTE) has
become law at a point in India's history when the ghastly practice
of female infanticide has resurfaced in the form of foeticide. This
is "symptomatic of a deeper turmoil" in society which is
compounding the traditional obstacles to the education of girls.
Tenacious prejudice against the intellectual potential of girls runs
across our cultural diversity and the system of education has not
been able to address it. [2011-II]

PASSAGE
For achieving inclusive growth there is a critical need to rethink
the role of the State. The early debate among economists about
the size of the Government can be misleading. The need of the
hour is to have an enabling Government. India is too large and
complex a nation for the State to be able to deliver all that is
needed. Asking the Government to produce all the essential goods,
create all the necessary jobs, and keep a curb on the prices of all
goods is to lead to a large cumbersome bureaucracy and
widespread corruption.
The aim must be to stay with the objective of inclusive
growth that was laid down by the founding fathers of the nation
and also to take a more modern view of what the State can
realistically deliver.
This is what leads to the idea of an enabling State, that is, a
Government that does not try to directly deliver to the citizens
everything that they need. Instead, it (1) creates an enabling ethos
for the market so that individual enterprise can flourish and citizens
can, for the most part, provide for the needs of one another, and
( 2 ) s te p s in to he lp tho s e w ho d o no t manag e to d o w e ll f o r
themselves, for there will always be individuals, no matter what

Government that, when it comes to the market, sets effective,
incentive-compatible rules and remains on the sidelines with7 General Comprehension

The concept of ‘creative society’ refers to a phase of development
of a society in which a large number of potential contradictions
become articulate and active. This is most evident when oppressed
social groups get politically mobilised and demand their rights.
The upsurge of the peasants and tribals, the movements for
regional autonomy and self-determination, the environmental
movements, and the women’s movements in the developing
countries are signs of emergence of creative society in
contemporary times. The forms of social movements and their
intensity may vary from country to country and place to placewithin a country . But the very presence of movements for social
transformation in various spheres of a society indicates the
emergence of a creative society in a country. [2011-II]

A country under foreign domination seeks escape from the
present in dreams of a vanished age, and finds consolation in
visions of past greatness. That is a foolish and dangerous pastime
in which many of us indulge. An equally questionable practice
for us in India is to imagine that we are still spiritually great though
we have come down in the world in other respects. Spiritual or
any other greatness cannot be founded on lack of freedom and
opportunity, or on starvation and misery . Many western writers
have encouraged that notion that Indians are other-worldly . I
suppose the poor and unfortunate in every country become to
some extent other-worldly , unless they become revolutionaries,
for this world is evidently not meant for them. So also subject
peoples.

PASSAGE
A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its
abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The
keystone species may influence both the species richness of
communities and the flow of energy and materials through
ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus , which lives in rocky
intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, is
also an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the
mussel Mytilus californianus . In the absence of sea stars, these
mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the
intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare
spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.
A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the
influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars
from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period
of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from which
sea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel bed
extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing that sea
stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are
covered with water most of the time. Second, and more
dramatically , 28 species of animals and algae disappeared fromthe sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant
competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on
competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely
determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.

Ecosystems provide people with a variety of goods and services;
food, clean water, clean air, flood control, soil stabilization,
pollination, climate regulation, spiritual fulfilment and aesthetic
enjoyment, to name just a few. Most of these benefits either are
irreplaceable or the technology necessary to replace them is
prohibitively expensive. For example, potable fresh water can be
provided by desalinating sea-water, but only at great cost.
The rapidly expanding human population has greatly modified
the Earth's ecosystems to meet their increased requirements of
some of the goods and services, particularly food, fresh water,
timber, fibre and fuel. These modifications have contributed
substantially to human well being and economic development.
The benefits have not been equally distributed. Some people
have actually been harmed by these changes. Moreover, short-
term increases in some ecosystem goods and services have come
at the cost of the long-term degradation of others. For example,
efforts to increase the production of food and fibre have decreased
the ability of some ecosystems to provide clean water, regulate
flooding and support biodiversity . [2011-II]

A moral act must be our own act; must spring from our own will.
If we act mechanically , there is no moral content in our act. Such
action would be moral, if we think it proper to act like a machine

bear in mind the distinction between acting mechanically and
acting intentionally . It may be moral of a king to pardon a culprit.
But the messenger carrying out the order of pardon plays only a
mechanical part in the king’s moral act. But if the messenger were
to carry out the king’s order considering it to be his duty , his
action would be a moral one. How can a man understand morality

Education, without a doubt, has an important functional,
instrumental and utilitarian dimension. This is revealed when one
asks questions such as ‘what is the purpose of education?’. The
answers, too often, are ‘to acquire qualifications for employment/
upward mobility’, ‘wider/higher (in terms of income) opportunities’,
and ‘to meet the needs for trained human power in diverse fields
for national development’. But in its deepest sense education is
not instrumentalist. That is to say , it is not to be justified outside
of itself because it leads to the acquisition of formal skills or of
certain desired psychological – social attributes. It must be
respected in itself. Education is thus not a commodity to be
acquired or possessed and then used, but a process of inestimable
importance to individuals and society , although it can and does
have enormous use value. Education then, is a process of
expansion and conversion, not in the sense of converting or
turning students into doctors or engineers, but the widening and
turning out of the mind—the creation, sustenance and
development of self-critical awareness and independence of
thought. It is an inner process of moral-intellectual development.

PASSAGE
Chemical pesticides lose their role in sustainable agriculture if the
pests evolve resistance. The evolution of pesticide resistance is
simply natural selection in action. It is almost certain to occur
when vast numbers of a genetically variable population are killed.
One or a few individuals may be unusually resistant (perhaps

Topicwise Solved PapersF114
because they possess an enzyme that can detoxify the pesticide).
If the pesticide is applied repeatedly, each successive generation
of the pest will contain a larger proportion of resistant individuals.
Pests typically have a high intrinsic rate of reproduction, and so
a few individuals in one generation may give rise to hundreds or
thousands in the next, and resistance spreads very rapidly in a
population.
This problem was often ignored in the past, even though
the first case of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) resistance
was reported early as 
1946. There is exponential increase in the
numbers of invertebrates that have evolved resistance and in the
number of pesticides against which resistance has evolved.
Resistance has been recorded in every family of arthropod pests
(including dipterans such as mosquitoes and house flies, as well
as beetles, moths, wasps, fleas, lice and mites) as well as in weeds
and plant pathogens. Take the Alabama leaf-worm, a moth pest of
cotton, as an example. It has developed resistance in one or more
regions of the world to aldrin, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, lindane and
toxaphene.
If chemical pesticides brought nothing but, problems, — if
their use was intrinsically and acutely unsustainable — then they
would already have fallen out of widespread use. This has not
happened. Instead, their rate of production has increased rapidly.
The ratio of cost to benefit for the individual agricultural producer
has remained in favour of pesticide use. In the USA, insecticides
have been estimated to benefit the agricultural products to the
tune of around $5 for every $1 spent.
Moreover, in many poorer countries, the prospect of
imminent mass starvation, or of an epidemic disease, are so
frightening that the social and health costs of using pesticides
have to be ignored. In general the use of pesticides is justified by
objective measures such as ‘lives saved’, ‘economic efficiency
of food production’ and ‘total food produced’. In these very
fundamental senses, their use may be described as sustainable.
In practice, sustainability depends on continually developing new
pesticides that keep at least one step ahead of the pests –
pesticides that are less persistent, biodegradable and more
accurately targeted all the pests. [2012-II]

PASSAGE
Today's developing economices use much less energy per capita
than developed countries such as the United States did at similar
incomes, showing the potential for lower-carbon growth.
Adaptation and mitigation need to be integrated into a climate-
smart development strategy that increases resilience, reduces the
threat of further global warming, and improves development
outcomes. Adaptation and mitigation measures can advance
development, and prosperity can raise incomes and foster better
institutions. A healthier population living in better-built houses
and with access to bank loans and social security is better
equipped to deal with a changing climate and its consequences.
Advancing robust, resilient development policies that promote
adaptation is needed today because changes in the climate,
already begun, will increase even in the short term.

But as growth has altered the environment and as environmental
change has accelerated, sustaining growth and adaptability
demands greater capacity to understand our environment,
generate new adaptive technologies and practices, and diffuse
them widely . As economic historians have explained, much of
humankind's creative potential has been directed at adapting to
the changing world. But adaptation cannot cope with all the


General Comprehension F115
impacts related to climate change, especially as larger changes
unfold in the long term.
Countries cannot grow out of harm's way fast enough to
match the changing climate. And some growth strategies, whether
driven by the government or the market, can also add to
vulnerability — particularly if they overexploit natural resources.
Under the Soviet development plan, irrigated cotton cultivation
expanded in water-stressed Central Asia and led to the near
disappearance of the Aral Sea, threatening the livelihoods of
fishermen, herders and farmers. And clearing mangroves — the
natural coastal buffers against storm surges — to make way for
intensive farming or housing development , increases the physical
vulnerability of coastal settlements, whether in Guinea or in
Louisiana. [2012-II]

38. Which of the following conditions of growth can add to
vulnerability?

1. When the growth occurs due to excessive exploitation
of mineral resources and forests.

2. When the growth brings about a change in humankind's

PASSAGE
Invasions of exotic species into new geographic areas sometimes
occur naturally and without human agency . However, human
actions have increased this trickle to a flood. Human-caused
introductions may occur either accidentally as a consequence of
human transport, or intentionally but illegally to serve some private
purpose or legitimately to procure some hoped-for public benefit
by bringing a pest under control, producing new agricultural
products or providing novel recreational opportunities. Many
introduced species are assimilated into communities without much
obvious effect. However, some have been responsible for dramatic
changes to native species and natural communities. For example,
the accidental introduction of the brown tree snake Boiga
irregularis into Guam, an island in the Pacific, has through nest
predation reduced 10 endemic forest bird species to the point of
extinction.
One of the major reasons for the world's great biodiversity
is the occurrence of centers of endemism so that similar habitats
in different parts of the world are occupied by different groups of
species that happen to have evolved there. If every species
naturally had access to everywhere on the globe, we might expect
a relatively small number of successful species to become dominant
in each biome. The extent to which this homogenization can
happen naturally is restricted by the limited powers of dispersal
of most species in the face of the physical barriers that exist to
dispersal. By virtue of the transport opportunities offered by
humans, these barriers have been breached by an ever-increasing
number of exotic species. The effects of introductions have been
to convert a hugely diverse range of local community
compositions into something much more homogeneous.
It would be wrong, however, to conclude that introducing
species to a region will inevitably cause a decline in species
richness there. For example, there are numerous species of plants,
invertebrates and vertebrates found in continental Europe but
absent from the British Isles (many because they have so far
failed to recolonize after the last glaciations). Their introduction
would be likely to augment British biodiversity . The significant
detrimental effect noted above arises where aggressive species
provide a novel challenge to endemic biotas ill-equipped to deal
with them. [2012-II]

PASSAGE
Most champions of democracy have been rather reticent in
suggesting that democracy would itself promote development
and enhancement of social welfare–they have tended to see them
as good but distinctly separate and largely independent goals.
The detractors of democracy, on the other hand, seemed to have
been quite willing to express their diagnosis of what they see as
serious tensions between democracy and development. The
theorists of the practical split — ‘‘Make up your mind : do you
want democracy, or instead, do you want development ?’’ —
often came, at least to start with, from East Asian countries, and
their voice grew in influence as several of these countries were
immensely successful — through the 1970s and 1980s and even
later — in promoting economic growth without pursuing
democracy.To deal with these issues we have to pay particular attention
to both the content of what can be called development and to the
interpretation of democracy (in particular to the respective roles
of voting and of public reasoning). The assessment of
development cannot be divorced from the lives that people can
lead and the real freedom that they enjoy . Development can
scarcely be seen merely in terms of enhancement of inanimate
objects of convenience, such as a rise in the GNP (or in personal
incomes), or industrialization – important as they may be as means
to the real ends. Their value must depend on what they do to the
lives and freedom of the people involved, which must be central
to the idea of development.
If development is understood in a broader way, with a focus
on human lives, then it becomes immediately clear that the relation
between development and democracy has to be seen partly in
terms of their constitutive connection, rather than only through
their external links. Even though the question has often been
asked whether political freedom is ‘‘conducive to development’’,
we must not miss the crucial recognition that political liberties
and democratic rights are among the “constituent components”
of development. Their relevance for development does not have
to be established indirectly through their contribution to be growth
of GNP. [2012-II]

49. According to the passage, why is a serious tension
perceived between democracy and development by the
detractors of democracy?
(a) Democracy and development are distinct and separate
goals.
(b) Economic growth can be promoted successfully
without pursuing a democratic system of governance.
(c) Non-democratic regimes deliver economic growth
faster and far more successfully than democratic ones.
(d) All the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above are
correct in this context.

assessment/aim/view of development?
(a) Rise in the per capita income and industrial growth

(c) Rise in the savings and consumption trends.
(d) Extent of real freedom that citizens enjoy.

51. What does a ‘‘constitutive’’ connection between democracy

The need for Competition Law becomes more evident when
foreign direct investment (FDI) is liberalized. The impact of FDI is
not always pro-competitive. V ery often FDI takes the form of a
foreign corporation acquiring a domestic enterprise or establishing
a joint venture with one. By making such an acquisition the foreign
investor may substantially lessen competition and gain a
dominant position in the relevant market, thus charging higher
prices. Another scenario is where the affiliates of two separate


General Comprehension F117
multinational companies (MNCs) have been established in
competition with one another in a particular developing economy,
following the liberalization of FDI. Subsequently , the parent
companies overseas merge. With the affiliates no longer remaining
independent, competition in the host country may be virtually
eliminated and the prices of the products may be artificially inflated.
Most of these adverse consequences of mergers and acquisitions
by MNCs can be avoided if an effective competition law is in
place. Also, an economy that has implemented an effective
competition law is in a better position to attract FDI than one that
has not. This is not just because most MNCs are expected to be
accustomed to the operation of such a law in their home countries
and know how to deal with such concerns but also that MNCs
expect competition authorities to ensure a level playing field
between domestic and foreign firms. [2012-II]

52. With reference to the passage, consider the following
statements:
1 . It is desirable that the impact of Foreign Direct

The poor especially in market economies, need the strength that
collectivities offer for creating more economic, social and political
space for themselves, for enhancing their socio-economic well-
being and voice, and as a protection against free market
individualism. It has been argued that a group approach to farming,
especially in the form of bottom up agricultural production
collectivities, offers substantial scope for poverty alleviation and
empowering the poor as well as enhancing agricultural
productivity . To realize this potential, however, the groups would
need to be voluntary in nature, small in size, participative in
decision making and equitable in work sharing and benefit
distribution. There are many notable examples of suchcollectivities to be found in varied contexts, such as in the
transition economies. All of them bear witness to the possibility
of successful cooperation under given conditions. And although
the gender impact of the family cooperatives in the transition
economies are uncertain, the Indian examples of women-only

In a typical Western liberal context, deepening of democracy
invariably leads to consolidation of 'liberal values'. In the Indian
context, democratization is translated into greater involvement of
people not as 'individuals' which is a staple to liberal discourse,
but as communities or groups. Individuals are getting involved in
the public sphere not as ‘atomized’ individuals but as members of
primordial communities drawn on religious or caste identity .
Community-identity seems to be the governing force. It is not
therefore surprising that the so-called peripheral groups continue
to maintain their identities with reference to the social groups
(caste, religion or sect) to which they belong while getting
involved in the political processes despite the fact that their
political goals remain more or less identical. By helping to articulate
the political voice of the marginalized, democracy in India has led
to ‘a loosening of social strictures’ and empowered the peripherals
to be confident of their ability to improve the socio-economic
conditions in which they are placed. This is a significant political
process that had led to a silent revolution through a meaningful
transfer of power from the upper caste elites to various subaltern
groups within the democratic framework of public governance.

Ecological research over the last quarter of the century has
established the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation due
to mining, highways and such other intrusions on forests. When
a large block of forests gets fragmented into smaller bits, the
edges of all these bits come into contact with human activities
resulting in the degradation of the entire forests. Continuity of
forested landscapes and corridors gets disrupted affecting several
extinction-prone species of wildlife. Habitat fragmentation is
therefore considered as the most serious threat to biodiversity
conservation. Ad hoc grants of forest lands to mining companies
coupled with rampant illegal mining is aggravating this threat.

The law in many parts of the world increasingly restricts the
discharge of agricultural slurry into watercourses. The simplest
and often the most economically sound practice returns the
material to the land as semisolid manure or as sprayed slurry.
This dilutes its concentration in the environment to what might
have occurred in a more primitive and sustainable types of
agriculture and converts pollutant into fertilizer. Soil
microoganisms decompose the organic components of sewage
and slurry and most of the mineral nutrients become available to
be absorbed again by the vegetation.
The excess input of nutrients, both nitrogen and phosphorus
– based, agricultural runoff (and human sewage) has caused many
‘healthy’ oligotrophic lakes (low nutrient concentrations, low
plant productivity with abundant water weeds, and clear water)
to change to eutrophic condition where high nutrient inputs leadto high phytoplankton productivity (sometimes dominated by
bloom-forming toxic species). This makes the water turbid,
eliminates large plants and, in the worst situations, leads to anoxia
and fish kills; so called cultural eutrophication. Thus, important
ecosystem services are lost, including the provisioning service
of wild-caught fish and the cultural services associated with
recreation.
The process of cultural eutrophication of lakes has been
understood for some time. But only recently did scientists notice
huge ‘dead zones’ in the oceans near river outlets., particularly
those draining large catchment areas such as the Mississippi in
North America and the Yangtze in China. The nutrient-enriched
water flows through streams, rivers and lakes, and eventually to
the estuary and ocean where the ecological impact may be huge,
killing virtually all invertebrates and fish in areas up to 70,000 km2
in extent. More than 150 sea areas worldwide are now regularly
starved of oxygen as a result of decomposition of algal blooms,
fuelled particularly by nitrogen from agricultural runoff of fertilizers
and sewage from large cities. Oceanic dead zones are typically
associated with industrialized nations and usually lie off countries
that subsidize their agriculture, encouraging farmers to increases
productivity and use more fertilizer. [2013-II]

63. According to the passage, why should the discharge of
agricultural slurry into watercourses be restricted?

1. Losing nutrients in this way is not a good practice
economically.

The subject of democracy has become severely muddled because
of the way the rhetoric surrounding it has been used in recent
years. There is, increasingly, an oddly confused dichotomy
between those who want to ‘impose’ democracy on countries in
the non-Western world (in these countries’ ‘own interest’, of
course) and those who are opposed to such ‘imposition’ (because
of the respect for the countries’ ‘own ways’). But the entire
language of ‘imposition’, used by both sides, is extraordinarily
inappropriate since it makes the implicit assumption that
democracy belongs exclusively to the West, taking it to be a
quintessentialy ‘Wester’ idea which has originated and flourished
only in the West.
But the thesis and the pessimism it generates about the
possibility of democratic practice in the world would be extremely
hard to justify. There were several experiments in local democracy
in ancient India. Indeed, in understanding the roots of democracy
in the world, we have to take an interest in the history of people
participation and public reasoning in different parts of the world.
We have to look beyond thinking of democracy only in terms of
European and American evolution. We would fail to understand
the pervasive demands for participatory living, on which Aristotle
spoke with far-reaching insight, if we take democracy to be a kind
of a specialized cultural product of the West.It cannot, of course, be doubted that the institutional structure
of the contemporary practice of democracy is largely the product
of European and American experience over the last few centuries.
This is extremely important to recognize since these developments
in institutional formats were immensely innovative and ultimately
effective. There can be little doubt that there is a major ‘Western’
achievement here. [2013-II]

70. Which of the following is closest to the view of democracy
as mentioned in the above passage?
(a) The subject of democracy is a muddle due to a desire
to portray it as a Western concept, ‘alien’ to non-
Western countries.
(b) The language of imposition of democracy is
inappropriate. There is, however, a need to consider
this concept in the backdrop of culture of ‘own ways’
of non-Western society.
(c) While democracy is not essentially a Western idea
belonging exclusively to the West, the institutional
structure of current democratic practices has been their
contribution.
(d) None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above is
correct.

71. With reference to the passage, the following assumption
have been made:

Corporate governance is based on principles such as conducting
the business with all integrity and fairness, being transparent
with regard to all transactions, making all the necessary disclosures
and decisions, complying with all the laws of the land,
accountability and responsibility towards the stakeholders and
commitment to conducting business in an ethical manner. Another
point which is highlighted on corporate governance is the need
for those in control to be able to distinguish between what are
personal and corporate funds while managing a company.
Fundamentally, there is a level of confidence that is
associated with a company that is known to have good corporate
governance. The presence of an active group of independent
directors on the board contributes a great deal towards ensuring
confidence in the market. Corporate governance is known to be
one of the criteria that foreign institutional investors are
increasingly depending on when deciding on which companies
to invest in. It is also known to have a positive influence on the
share price of the company. Having a clean image on the corporate
governance front could also make it easier for companies to source
capital at more reasonable costs. Unfortunately, corporate
governance often becomes the centre of discussion only after
the exposure of a large scam. [2013-II]

Malnutrition most commonly occurs between the ages of six
months and two years. This happens despite the child’s food
requirements being less than that of an older child. Malnutrition
is often attributed to poverty, but it has been found that even in
households where adults eat adequate quantities of food, more
than 50 per cent of children-under-five do not consume enough
food. The child’s dependence on someone else to feed him/her is
primarily responsible for the malnutrition. Very often the mother
is working and the responsibility of feeding the young child is
left to an older sibling. It is therefore crucial to increase awareness
regarding the child’s food needs and how to satisfy them.

A number of empirical studies find that farmers are risk-averse,
though only moderately in many cases. There is also evidence to
show that farmers’ risk aversion results in cropping patterns and
input use designed to reduce risk rather than to maximize income.
Farmers adopt a number of strategies to manage and cope with
agricultural risks. These include practices like crop and field
diversification, non-farm ‘employment storage of stocks and
strategic migration of family members. There are also institutions
ranging from share tenancy to kinship, extended family and
informal credit agencies. One major obstacle to risk sharing byfarmers is that the same type of risks can affect a large number of
farmers in the region. Empirical studies show that the traditional
methods are not adequate. Hence there is a need for policy
interventions, especially measures that cut across geographical
regions.
Polices may aim at tackling agricultural risks directly or
indirectly. Examples of risk-specific policies are crop insurance,
price stabilization and the development of varieties resistant to
pests and diseases. Policies which affect risk indirectly are
irrigation, subsidized credit and access to information. No single
risk-specific policy is sufficient to reduce risk and is without side-
effects, whereas policies not specific to risk influence the general
situation and affect risks only indirectly. Crop insurance, as a
policy measure to tackle agricultural risk directly, deserves careful
consideration in the Indian context and in many other developing
countries – because the majority of farmers depend on rain-fed
agriculture and in many areas yield variability is the predominant
cause of their income instability. [2013-II]

76. The need for policy intervention mitigate risks in agriculture
is because
(a) farmers are extremely risk-averse.
(b) farmers do not know how to mitigate risks.
(c) the methods adopted by farmers and existing risk
sharing institutions are not adequate.
(d) majority of farmers depend on rain-fed agriculture.

77. Which of the following observations emerges from the above
passage?
(a) One can identify a single policy that can reduce risk
without any side-effect.
(b) No single task-specific policy is sufficient to reduce
agricultural risk.
(c) Policies which affect risk indirectly can eliminate it.
(d) Government’s policy intervention can mitigate
agricultural risk completely.

Financial markets in India have acquired greater depth and liquidity
over the years. Steady reforms since 1991 have led to growing
linkages and integration of the Indian economy and its financial
system with the global economy. Weak global economic
prospects and continuing uncertainties in the international
financial markets therefore, have had their impact on the emerging
market economies. Sovereign risk concerns, particularly in the
Euro area, affected financial markets for the greater part of the
year, with the contagion of Greece’s soveregin debt problem
spreading to India and other economies by way of higher-than-
normal levels of volatility.
The funding constraints in international financial markets
could impact both the availability and cost of foreign funding for
banks and corporates. Since the Indian financial system is bank-
dominated, banks’ ability to withstand stress is critical to overall
financial stability. Indian banks, however, remain robust,
notwithstanding a decline in capital to risk-weighted assets ratio
and a rise in non-performing asset levels in the recent past. Capital
adequacy levels remain above the regulatory requirements. The
financial market infrastructure continues to function without any
major disruption. With further globalization, consolidation,
deregulation, and diversification of the financial system, the
banking business may become more complex and riskier. Issues
like risk and liquidity management and enhancing skill therefore
assume greater significance. [2013-II]

Crude mineral oil comes out of the earth as a thick brown or black
liquid with a strong smell. It is a complex mixture of many different
substances, each with its own individual qualities. Most of them
are combinations of hydrogen and carbon in varying proportions.
Such hydrocarbons are also found in other forms such as bitumen,
asphalt and natural gas. Mineral oil originates from the carcasses
of tiny animals and from plants that live in the sea. Over millions
of years, these dead creatures form large deposits under the sea-
bed; and ocean currents cover them with a blanket of sand and
silt. As this mineral hardens, it becomes sedimentary rock and
effectively shuts out the oxygen, so preventing the complete
decomposition of the marine deposits underneath. The layers of
sedimentary rock become thicker and heavier. Their pressure
produces heat, which transforms the tiny carcasses into crude oil
in a process that is still going on today. [2013-II]

82. Mineral oil deposits under the sea do not get completely
decomposed because they
(a) are constantly washed by the ocean currents.
(b) become rock and prevent oxygen from entering them.
(c) contain a mixture of hydrogen and carbon.
(d) are carcasses of organisms lying in saline conditions.

83. Sedimentary rock leads to the formation of oil deposits
because
(a) there are no saline conditions below it.
(b) it allows some dissolved oxygen to enter the dead
organic matter below it.(c) weight of overlying sediment layers causes the
production of heat.
(d) it contains the substances that catalyze the chemical
reactions required to change dead organisms into oil.

Many nations now place their faith in capitalism and governments
choose it as the strategy to create wealth for their people. The
spectacular economic growth seen in Brazil, China and India after
the liberalisation of their economies is proof of its enormous
potential and success. However, the global banking crisis and the
economic recession have left many bewildered. The debates tend
to focus on free market operations and forces, their efficiency and
their ability for self correction. Issues of justice, integrity and
honesty are rarely elaborated to highlight the failure of the global
banking system. The apologists of the system continue to justify
the success of capitalism and argue that the recent crisis was a blip.
Their arguments betray an ideological bias with the assumptions
that an unregulated market is fair and competent, and that the
exercise of private greed will be in the larger public interest.
Few recognize the bidirectional relationship between capitalism
and greed; that each reinforces the other. Surely, a more honest
conceptualisation of the conflicts of interest among the rich and
powerful players who have benefited from the system, their biases
and ideology is needed; the focus on the wealth creation should
also highlight the resultant gross inequity. [2014-II]

Net profits are only 
2.2% of their total assets for central public
sector undertakings, lower than for the private corporate sector.
While the public sector or the State-led entrepreneurship played
an important role in triggering India's industrialization, our evolving
development needs, comparatively less-than-satisfactory
performance of the public sector enterprises, the maturing of our
private sector, a much larger social base now available for
expanding entrepreneurship and the growing institutional
capabilities to enforce competition policies would suggest that
the time has come to review the role of public sector.
What should the portfolio composition of the government
be? It should not remain static all times. The airline industry works
well as a purely private affair. At the opposite end, rural roads,

Topicwise Solved PapersF122
whose sparse traffic makes tolling unviable, have to be on the
balance-sheet of the State. If the government did not own rural
roads, they would not exist. Similarly, public health capital in our
towns and cities will need to come from the public sector. Equally,
preservation and improvement of forest cover will have to be a
new priority for the public sector assets.
Take the example of steel. With near-zero tariffs, India is a
globally competitive market for the metal. Indian firms export steel
into the global market, which demonstrates there is no gap in
technology. Indian companies are buying up global steel
companies, which shows there is no gap in capital availability.
Under these conditions, private ownership works best.
Private ownership is clearly desirable in regulated industries,
ranging from finance to infrastructure, where a government agency
performs the function of regulation and multiple competing firms
are located in the private sector. Here, the simple and clean solution
- government as the umpire and the private sector as the players
is what works best. In many of these industries, we have a legacy
of government ownership, where productivity tends to be lower,
fear of bankruptcy is absent, and the risk of asking for money
from the tax payer is ever present. There is also the conflict of
interest between government as an owner and as the regulator.
The formulation and implementation of competition policy will be
more vigorous and fair if government companies are out of action.

Climate change poses potentially devastating effects on India's
agriculture. While the overall parameters of climate change are
increasingly accepted-a 1°C average temperature increase over
the next 30 years, sea level rise of less than 10 cm in the same
period, and regional monsoon variations and corresponding
droughts-the impacts in India are likely to be quite site and crop
specific. Some crops may respond favourably to the changing
conditions, others may not. This emphasizes the need to promote
agricultural research and create maximum flexibility in the system
to permit adaptations.
The key ingredient for “drought proofing” is the managed
recharge of aquifers. To ensure continued yields of important
staple crops (e.g. wheat), it may also be necessary to shift the
locations where these crops are grown, in response to temperature
changes as well as to water availability. The latter will be a key
factor in making long term investment decisions.
For example, water runoff from the Himalayas is predicted to
increase over the next 30 years as glaciers melt, but then decline
substantially thereafter. It will be critical to provide incentives to
plan for these large-scale shifts in agro-ecological conditions.
India needs to make long term investment in research and
development in agriculture. India is likely to experience changed
weather patterns in future. [2014-II]

It is essential that we mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases
and thus avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change that
would take place in coming years and decades. Mitigation would
require a major shift in the way we produce and consume energy.
A shift away from overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels is
now long overdue, but unfortunately, technological development
has been slow and inadequate largely because government
policies have not promoted investments in research and
development, myopically as a result of relatively low prices of oil.
It is now , therefore, imperative for a country like India treating the
opportunity of harnessing renewable energy on a large scale as a
national imperative. This country is extremely well endowed with
solar, wind and biomass sources of energy. Where we have lagged,
unfortunately , is in our ability to develop and to create
technological solutions for harnessing these resources.


General Comprehension F123
One particular trajectory for carryingout stringent mitigation
of greenhouse gas emissions assessed by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly shows the need for
ensuring that global emissions of greenhouse gases peak no later
than 2015 and reduce rapidly thereafter. The cost associated with
such a trajectory is truly modest and would amount, in the
estimation of IPCC, to not more than 3 percent of the global GDP
in 
2030. In other words, the level of prosperity that the world
would have reached without mitigation would at worst be
postponed by a few months or a year at the most. This is clearly
not a very high price to pay for protecting hundreds of millions of
people from the worst risks associated with climate change. Any
such effort, however, would require lifestyles to change
appropriately also. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is
not a mere technological fix, and clearly requires changes in
lifestyles and transformation of a country's economic structure,
whereby effective reduction in emissions is brought about, such
as through the consumption of much lower quantities of animal
protein. The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has determined that the emissions from
the livestock sector amount to 18 percent of the total. The
reduction of emissions from this source is entirely in the hands of
human beings, who have never questioned the impacts that their
dietary habits of consuming more and more animal protein are
bringing about. Mitigation overall has huge co-benefits, such as
lower air pollution and health benefits, higher energy security
and greater employment. [2014-II]

PASSAGE
In recent times, India has grown fast not only compared to its
own past but also incomparison with other nations. But there
cannot be any room for complacency because it is possible forthe Indian economy to develop even faster and also to spread the
benefits of this growth more widely than has been done thus far.
Before going into details of the kinds of micro-structural changes
that we need to conceptualize and then proceed to implement, it
is worthwhile elaborating on the idea of inclusive growth that
constitutes the defining concept behind this Government's various
economic policies and decisions. A nation interested in inclusive
growth views the same growth differently depending on whether
the gains of the growth are heaped primarily on a small segment
or shared widely by the population. The latter is cause for
celebration but not the former. In other words, growth must not
be treated as an end in itself but as an instrument for spreading
prosperity to all. India's own past experience and the experience
of other nations suggests that growth is necessary for eradicating
poverty but it is not a sufficient condition. In other words, policies
for promoting growth need to be complemented with policies to
ensure that more and more people join in the growth process and,
further, that there are mechanisms inplace to redistribute some of
the gains to those who are unable to partake in the market process
and, hence, get left behind.
A simple way of giving this idea of inclusive growth a sharper
form is to measure a nation's progress in terms of the progress of
its poorest segment, for instance the bottom 20 per cent of the
population. One could measure the per capita income of the bottom
quintile of the population and also calculate the growth rate of
income; and evaluate our economic success in terms of these
measures that pertain to the poorest segment. This approach is
attractive because it does not ignore growth like some of the
older heterodox criteria did. It simply looks at the growth of income
of the poorest sections of the population. It also ensures that
those who are outside of the bottom quintile do not get ignored.
If that were done, then those people would in all likelihood drop
down into the bottom quintile and so would automatically become
a direct target of our policies. Hence the criterion being suggested
here is a statistical summing up of the idea of inclusive growth,
which, in turn, leads to two corollaries : to wish that India must
strive to achieve high growth and that we must work to ensure
that the weakest segments benefit from the growth. [2014-II]

It is easy for the government to control State-owned companies
through nods and winks. So what really needs to be done as a
first step is to put petrol pricing on a transparent formula-if the
price of crude is x and the exchange rate y, then every month or
fortnight, the government announces a maximum price of petrol,
which anybody can work out from the x and the y. The rule has to
be worked out to make sure that the oil-marketing companies can,
in general, cover their costs. This will mean that if one company
can innovate and cut costs, it will make greater profits. Hence,
firms will be more prone to innovate and be efficient under this
system. Once the rule is announced, there should be no
interference by the government. If this is done for a while, private
companies will re-enter this market. And once a sufficient number
of them are in the fray, we can remove the rule-based pricing and

The Himalayan ecosystem is highly vulnerable to damage, both
due to geological reasons and on account of the stress caused
by increased pressure of population, exploitation of natural
resources and other related challenges. These aspects may be
exacerbated due to the impact of climate change. It is possible
that climate change may adversely impact the Himalayan
ecosystem through increased temperature, altered precipitation
patterns, episodes of drought and biotic influences. This would
not only impact the very sustenance of the indigenous
communities in uplands but also the life of downstream dwellers
across the country and beyond. Therefore, there is an urgent
need for giving special attention to sustain the Himalayan
ecosystem. This would require conscious efforts for conserving
all the representative systems. Further, it needs to be emphasized
that the endemics with restricted distribution, and most often
with specialized habitat requirements, are among the most
vulnerable elements. In this respect the Himalayan biodiversity
hotspot, with rich endemic diversity, is vulnerable to climate
change. The threats include possible loss of genetic resources
and species, habitats and concomitantly a decrease in ecosystemservices. Therefore, conservation of endemic elements in
representative ecosystems/habitats assumes a great significance
while drawing conservation plans for the region.
Towards achieving the above, we will have to shift toward
contemporary conservation approaches, which include a paradigm
of landscape level interconnectivity between protected area
systems. The concept advocates a shift from the species-habitat
focus to an inclusive focus on expanding the biogeographic range
so that natural adjustments to climate change can proceed without

It is often forgotten that globalization is not only about policies
on international economic relationships and transactions, but has
equally to do with domestic policies of a nation. Policy changes
necessitated by meeting the internationally set conditions (by
WTO etc.) of free trade and investment flows obviously affect
domestic producers and investors. But the basic philosophy
underlying globalization emphasizes absolute freedom to markets
to determine prices and production and distribution patterns, and


General Comprehension F125
view government interventions as processes that create
distortions and bring in inefficiency. Thus, public enterprises
have to be privatized through disinvestments and sales; sectors
and activities hitherto reserved for the public sector have to be
opened to the private sector. This logic extends to the social
services like education and health. Any restrictions on the
adjustments in workforce by way of retrenchment of workers
should also be removed and exit should be made easier by
removing any restrictions on closures. Employment and wages
should be governed by free play of market forces, as any measure
to regulate them can discourage investment and also create
inefficiency in production. Above all, in line with the overall
philosophy of reduction in the role of the State, fiscal reforms
should be undertaken to have generally low levels of taxation
and government expenditure should be kept to the minimum to
abide by the principle of fiscal prudence. All these are policy
actions on the domestic front and are not directly related to the
core items of the globalization agenda, namely free international
flow of goods and finance. [2014-II]

106. According to the passage, under the globalization, government
interventions are viewed as processes leading to
(a) distortions and inefficiency in the economy.
(b) optimum use of resources.
(c) more profitability to industries.
(d) free play of market forces with regard to industries.

107. According to the passage, the basic philosophy of
globalization is to
(a) give absolute freedom to producers to determine prices
and production.
(b) give freedom to producers to evolve distribution
patterns.
(c) give absolute freedom to markets to determine prices,
production and employment.
(d) give freedom to producers to import and export.

The richer States have a responsibility to cut down carbon
emissions and promote clean energy investments. These are the
States that got electricity , grew faster and now have high per
capita income, making them capable of sharing India's burden of
becoming eco-friendly. Delhi, for example, can help by generating
its own clean electricity using solar rooftop panels or even help
poor States finance their clean energy projects. It is no secret that
State Electricity Boards, which control 95% of the distribution
network, are neck-deep in losses. These losses further discourage
State utilities from adopting renewable energy as it is more
expensive than fossil fuels. [2015-II]
110. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
assumption that can be made from the above passage?
(a) The richer States must lead in the production and
adoption of renewable energy.
(b) The poor States always have to depend on rich States

(c) The State Electricity Boards can improve their finances
by undertaking clean energy projects.
(d) The high economic disparity between the rich and poor

V ast numbers of Indian citizens without bank accounts live in
rural areas, are financially and functionally illiterate, and have
little experience with technology. A research study was conducted
in a particular area in which electronic wage payments in Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme

that recipients often assume that the village leader needs to mediate
the process, as was the case under the previous paper-based
system. Among households under this research study area who
claimed to have at least one bank account, over a third reported
still receiving MGNREGS wages in cash directly from a village

Individuals, groups and leaders who promote human
development operate under strong institutional, structural and
political constraints that affect policy options. But experience
suggests broad principles for shaping an appropriate agenda for
human development. One important finding from several decades
of human development experience is that focusing exclusively on
economic growth is problematic. While we have good knowledge
about how to advance health and education, the causes of growth
are much less certain and growth is often elusive. Further, an
unbalanced emphasis on growth is often associated with negative
environmental consequences and adverse distributional effects.
The experience of China, with its impressive growth record, reflects
these broader concerns and underlines the importance of balanced
approaches that emphasize investments in the non-income aspects
of human development. [2015-II]

116. With reference to the above passage, consider the following
statements:
1 . In developing countries, a strong institutional

India accounts for nearly a fifth of the world's child deaths. In
terms of numbers, it is the highest in the world-nearly 16 lakhs
every year. Of these, more than half die in the first month of life.
Officials believe that the reason for this is the absence of steps to
propagate basic health practices relating to breast feeding and
immunisation. Also the large reproductive population of 
2.6 crore
remains bereft of care during the critical phases of pregnancy and
post-delivery . Added to this is the prevalence of child marriages,
anaemia among young women and lack of focus on adolescent
sanitation, all of which impact child death rates. [2015-II]

I must say that, beyond occasionally exposing me to laughter, my
constitutional shyness has been of no disadvantage whatever.
In fact I can see that, on the contrary , it has been all to my
advantage. My hesitancy in speech, which was once an
annoyance, is now a pleasure. Its greatest benefit has been that it
has taught me the economy of words. I have naturally formed the
habit of restraining my thoughts. And I can now give myself the
certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue
or pen. I do not recollect ever having had to regret anything in my
speech or writing. I have thus been spared many a mishap and
waste of time. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the
spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate,
to suppress or modify the truth, wittingly or unwittingly , is a
natural weakness of man, and silence is necessary in order to
surmount it. A man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his
speech; he will measure every word. We find so many people
impatient to talk. There is no chairman of a meeting who is not
pestered with notes for permission to speak. And whenever the
permission is given the speaker generally exceeds the time-limit,
asks for more time, and keeps on talking without permission. All
this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. It
is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my
shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in
my discernment of truth. [2015-II]

his tongue or pen. Which one of the following is not a valid
reason for this?
(a) He has no intention to waste his time.

Climate change is a complex policy issue with major implications
in terms of finance. All actions to address climate change ultimately
involve costs. Funding is vital for countries like India to design
and implement adaptation and mitigation plans and projects. Lackof funding is a large impediment to implementing adaptation plans.
The scale and magnitude of the financial support required by
developing countries to enhance their domestic mitigation and
adaptation actions are a matter of intense debate in the multilateral
negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Convention squarely puts
the responsibility for provision of financial support on the
developed countries, taking into account their contribution to
the stock of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Given
the magnitude of the task and the funds required, domestic
finances are likely to fall short of the current and projected needs
of the developing countries. Global funding through the
multilateral mechanism of the Convention will enhance their
domestic capacity to finance the mitigation efforts. [2015-II]

calories and nutrients. Nearly one-half of India's children remain
malnourished. Lakhs of them die from preventable conditions.
Diarrhoea leaves Indians' bodies smaller on average than those

The existence/establishment of formal financial institutions that
offer safe, reliable and alternative financial instruments is
fundamental in mobilising savings. To save, individuals need
access to safe and reliable financial institutions, such as banks,
and to appropriate financial instruments and reasonable financial
incentives. Such access is not always available to all people in
developing countries like India and more so, in rural areas. Savings
help poor households manage volatility in cash flow, smoothen
consumption, and build working capital. Poor households without
access to a formal savings mechanism encourage immediate
spending temptations. [2015-II]

Governments may have to take steps which would otherwise be
an infringement on the Fundamental Rights of individuals, such
as acquiring a person's land against his will, or refusing permission
for putting up a building, but the larger public interest for which

Discretionary powers to the administration can be done away
with. It is becoming more and more difficult to keep this power
within limits as the government has many number of tasks to
perform. Where discretion has to be used, there must be rules
and safeguards to prevent misuse of that power. Systems have to
be devised which minimise, if not prevent, the abuse of

Climate adaptation may be rendered ineffective if policies are not
designed in the context of other development concerns. For
instance, a comprehensive strategy that seeks to improve food
security in the context of climate change may include a set of
coordinated measures related to agricultural extension, crop
diversification, integrated water and pest management and
agricultural information series. Some of these measures may have
to do with climate changes and others with economic
development.

141. What is the most logical and rational inference that can be
made from the above passage? [2016-II]
(a) It is difficult to pursue climate adaptation in the
developing countries
(b) Improving food security is a far more complex issue
than climate adaptation
(c) Every developmental activity is directly or indirectly
linked to climate adaptation

Understanding of the role of biodiversity in the hydrological
cycle enables better policy-making. The term biodiversity refers
to the variety of plants, animals, microorganisms, and the
ecosystems in which they occur. Water and biodiversity areinterdependent. In reality, the hydrological cycle decides how
biodiversity functions. In turn, vegetation and soil drive the
movement of water. Every glass of water we drink has, at least in
part, passed through fish, trees, bacteria, soil and other
organisms. Passing through these ecosystems, it is cleansed and
made fit for consumption. The supply of water is a critical service
that the environment provides.

142. Which among the following is the most critical inference
that can be made from the above passage ? [2016-II]
(a) Biodiversity sustains the ability of nature to recycle

Safe and sustainable sanitation in slums has immeasurable
benefits to women and girls in terms of their health, safety ,
privacy and dignity. However, women do not feature in most of

All humans digest mother’s milk as infants, but until cattle began
being domesticated 10,000 years ago, children once weaned no
longer needed to digest milk. As a result, they stopped making
the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the sugar lactose into
simple sugars. After humans began herding cattle, it became
tremendously advantageous to digest milk, and lactose tolerance
evolved independently among cattle herders in Europe, the
middle East and Africa. Groups not dependant on cattle, such as
the Chinese and Thai, remain lactose intolerant.

An increase in human-made carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
could initiate a chain reaction between plants and
microorganisms that would unsettle one of the largest carbon
reservoirs on the planet–soil. In a study , it was found that the
soil, which contains twice the amount of carbon present in all
plants and Earth’s atmosphere combined, could become
increasingly volatile as people add more carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere. This is largely because of increased plant growth.
Although a greenhouse gas and a pollutant, carbon dioxide also
supports plant growth. As trees and other vegetation flourish in
a carbon dioxide-rich future, their roots could stimulate microbial
activity in soil that may in turn accelerate the decomposition of
soil carbon and its release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

Historically , the biggest challenge to world agriculture has been
to achieve a balance between demand for and supply of food. At
the level of individual countries, the demand-supply balance can
be a critical issue for a closed economy , especially if it is a
populous economy and its domestic agriculture is not growing
sufficiently enough to ensure food supplies, on an enduring
basis; it is not so much and not always, of a constraint for an
open, and growing economy, which has adequate exchange
surplus to buy food abroad. For the world as a whole, Supply-
demand balance is always an inescapable prerequisite for
warding off hunger and starvation. However, global availability
of adequate supply does not necessarily mean that food would
automatically move from countries of surplus to countries of
deficit if the latter lack in purchasing power. The uneven
distribution of Hunger, starvation, under or malnourishment, etc.,
at the world-level, thus owes itself to the presence of empty-
pock hungry mouths, overwhelmingly confined to the
underdeveloped economies. In as much as ‘a two-square meal’ is
of elemental significance to basic human existence, the issue of
worldwide supply` of food has been gaining significance, in
recent times, both because the quantum and the composition of
demand has been undergoing big changes, and because, in
recent years, the capabilities individual countries to generate
uninterrupted chain of food supplies have come under strain.
Food production, marketing and prices, especially price-
affordability by the poor in the developing world, have become

Accountability , or the lack of it, in governance generally , and civil
services, in particular, is a major factor underlying the
deficiencies in governance and public administration. Designing
an effective framework for accountability has been a key element
of the reform agenda. A fundamental issue is whether civil
services should be accountable to the political executive of the
day or to society at large. In other words, how should internal
and external accountability be reconciled? Internal
accountability is sought to be achieved by internal performance
monitoring, official supervision by bodies like the–Central–
Vigilance Commission–and–Comptroller and Auditor– General,
and judicial review of executive decisions. Articles 311 and 312 of
the Indian Constitution provide job security and safeguards to
the civil services, especially the All India Services. The framers of
the Constitution had envisaged that provision of these
safeguards would result in a civil service that is not totally
subservient to the political executive but will have the strength to
function in larger public interest. The need to balance internal
and external accountability is thus built into the Constitution.
The issue is where to draw the line. Over the years, the emphasis
seems to have tilted in favour of greater internal accountability of
the civil services to the political leaders of the day who in turn are
expected to be externally accountable to the society at large
through the election process. This system for seeking
accountability to society has not worked out, and has led to
several adverse consequences for governance.
Some special measures can be considered for improving
accountability in civil services. Provisions of articles 311 and 312
should be reviewed and laws and regulations framed to ensure
external accountability of civil services. The proposed Civil
Services Bill seeks to address some of these requirements. The
respective roles of professional civil services and the political
executive should be defined so that professional managerial
functions and management of civil services are depoliticized. For
this purpose, effective statutory civil service boards should be

created at the centre and in the states. Decentralization and
devolution of authority to bring government and decision
making closer to the people also helps to enhance accountability .

In general, religious traditions stress our duty to god, or to some
universal ethical principle. Our duties to one another derive from
these. The religious concept of rights is primarily derived from
our relationship to this divinity or principle and the implication it

rights and duties is critical to any further understanding of
justice. But, for justice to be practiced; viture, rights and duties
cannot remain formal abstractions. They must be grounded in a
community (common unity) bound together by a sense of
common union (communion). Even as a personal virtue, this

Biomass as fuel for power, heat, and transport has the highest
mitigation potential of all renewable sources. It comes from
agriculture and forest residues as well as from energy crops. The
biggest challenge in using biomass residues is a long-term
reliable supply delivered to the power plant at reasonable costs;
the key problems are logistical constraints and the costs of fuel
collection. Energy crops, if not managed properly , compete with
food production and may have undesirable impacts on food
prices. Biomass production is also sensitive to the physical
impacts of a changing climate.
Projections of the future role of biomass are probably
overestimated, given the limits to the sustainable biomass
supply , unless breakthrough technologies substantially increase
productivity . Climate -energy models project that biomass use
could increase nearly four-fold to around 150 – 200 exajoules,
almost a quarter of world primary energy in 
2050. However the
maximum sustainable technical potential of biomass resources
(both residues and energy crops) without disruption of food and
forest resources ranges from 80 – 170 exajoules a year by 2050,
and only part of this is realistically and economically feasible. In
addition, some climate models rely on biomass-based carbon
capture and storage, an unproven technology, to achieve
negative emissions and to buy some time during the first half of
the century. 
Some liquid biofuels such as corn-based ethanol, mainly
for transport, may aggravate rather than ameliorate carbon
emissions on a life-cycle basis. Second generation biofuels,
based on ligno-cellulosic feedstocks – such as straw, bagasse,
grass and wood – hold the promise of sustainable production
that is high-yielding and emit low levels of greenhouse gases,
but these are still in the R & D stage.

We are witnessing a dangerous dwindling of biodiversity in our
food supply. The green revolution is a mixed blessing. Over time
farmers have come to rely heavily on broadly adapted, high yield
crops to the exclusion of varieties adapted to the local conditions.
Monocropping vast fields with the same genetically uniform seeds
helps boost yield and meet immediate hunger needs. Yet high-yield
varieties are also genetically weaker crops that require expensive

In a democratic State, where a high degree of political maturity
of the people obtains, the conflict between the will of the
sovereign law- making body and the organized will of the
people seldom occurs.

PASSAGE
A successful democracy depends upon widespread interest
and participation in politics, in which voting is an essential
part. To deliberately refrain from taking such an interest, and
from voting, is a kind of implied anarchy; it is to refuse one's
political responsibility while enjoying the benefits of a free
political society.

178. This passage relates to [2017-II]
(a) duty to vote
(b) right to vote
(c) freedom to vote
(d) right to participate in politics
PASSAGE
In a free country, the man who reaches the position of leader
is usually one of outstanding character and ability. Moreover,
it is usually possible to foresee that he will reach such a
position, since early in life one can see his qualities of character.
But this is not always true in the case of a dictator, often he
reaches his position of power through chance, very often
through the unhappy state of his country.

179. The passage seems to suggest that [2017-II]
(a) a leader foresees his future position
(b) a leader is chosen only by a free country
(c) a leader must see that his country is free from despair
(d) despair in a country sometimes leads to dictatorship
PASSAGE
The greatest blessing that technological progress has in store
for mankind is not, of course, an accumulation of material
possessions. The amount of these that can be effectively
enjoyed by one individual in one lifetime is not great. But there
is not the same narrow limit to the possibilities of the enjoyment

assumptions have been made: [2017-II]

1. People always see the leisure time as a gift and use
it for acquiring more material possessions.

2. Use of leisure by some people to produce new and

intelligent interpretation of current events". But the sage who
uttered these words of wisdom might well have added something
on the benefits of studying particularly the famous battles of
history for the lessons they contain for those of as who lead

PASSAGE
Disruption of traditional institutions, identifications and loyalties
is likely to lead to ambivalent situations. It is possible that
some people may renew their identification with traditional
groups whereas others align themselves with new groups and
symbols emergent from processes of political development. In
addition, political development tends to foster group awareness
of a variety of class, tribe, region, clan, language, religion,
occupation and others.

182. Which one of the following is the best explanation of the
above passage? [2017-II]
(a) Political development is not a unilinear process for
it involves both growth and decay.
(b) Traditional societies succeed in resisting positive
aspects of political development.
(c) It is impossible for traditional societies to break away
from lingering loyalties.
(d) Sustenance of traditional loyalties is conducive to
political development.
PASSAGE
There has been a significant trend worldwide towards
regionalism in government, resulting in a widespread transfer of
powers downwards towards regions and communities since
1990s. This process, which involves the creation of new political
entities and bodies at a sub-national level and an increase in
their content and powers, is known as devolution. Devolution
has been characterized as being made up of three factors--
political legitimacy, decentralization of authority and
decentralization of resources. Political legitimacy here means a
mass demand from below for the decentralization process, which
is able to create a political force for it to take place. In many


General Comprehension F137
cases, decentralization is initiated by the upper tier of
government without sufficient political mobilization for it at the
grassroots level, and in such cases the decentralization process
often does not fulfil its objectives.

183. Which among the following is the most logical, rational
and critical inference that can be made from the above
passage? [2017-II]
(a) Emergence of powerful mass leaders is essential to
create sub-national political entities and thus ensure
successful devolution and decentralization.
(b) The upper tier of government should impose
devolution and decentralization on the regional
communities by law or otherwise.
(c) Devolution, to be successful, requires a democracy
in which there is free expression of the will of the
people at lower level and their active participation at
the grass roots level.
(d) For devolution to take place, a strong feeling of
regionalism in the masses is essential.

We live in digital times. The digital is not just something we use
strategically and specifically to do a few tasks. Our very perception
of who we are, how we connect to the world around us, and the
ways in which we define our domains of life, labour and language
are hugely structured by the digital technologies. The digital is
everywhere and, like air, invisible. We live within digital systems,
we live with intimate gadgets, we interact through digital media,
and the very presence and imagination of the digital has
dramatically restructured our lives. The digital, far from being a
tool, is a condition and context that defines the shapes and
boundaries of our understanding of the self, the society , and the
structure of governance.

184. Which among the following is the most logical and
essential message conveyed by the above passage?
[2017-II]
(a) All problems of governance can be solved by using
digital technologies.
(b) Speaking of digital technologies is speaking of our
life and living.
(c) Our creativity and imagination cannot be expressed
without digital media.
(d) Use of digital systems is imperative for the existence
of mankind in future.

The IMF has pointed out that the fast growing economies of
Asia face the risk of falling into 'middle-income trap'. It means
that average incomes in these countries, which till now have
been growing rapidly, will stop growing beyond a point-a point
that is well short of incomes in the developed West. The IMF
identifies a number of causes of middle-income trap-none of
which is surprising-from infrastructure to weak institutions, to
less than favourable macroeconomic conditions. But the broad,

185. Which among the following is the most logical, rational
and critical inference that can be made from the above
passage? [2017-II]
(a) Once a country reaches middle-income stage, it runs
the risk of falling productivity which leads to stagnant
incomes.(b) Falling into middle-income trap is a general
characteristic of fast growing economies.
(c) There is no hope at all for emerging Asian economies
to sustain the growth momentum.
(d) As regards growth of productivity, the performance
of Asian economies is not satisfactory.
PASSAGE
An innovative India will be inclusive as tell as technologically
advanced, improving it lives of all Indians. Innovation and
R&D can mitigate increases in social inequality and relieve the
pressures created by rapid urbanization. The growing divergence
in productivity between agriculture and knowledge-intensive
manufacturing and services threatens to increase income
inequality. By encouraging India's R&D labs and universities
to focus on the needs of poor people and by improving the
ability of informal firms to absorb knowledge, an innovation
and research agenda can counter this effect. Inclusive
innovation can lower the costs of goods and services and
create income-earning opportunities for the poor people.

186. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
assumption that c an b e mad e f ro m the ab o v e p as s ag e ?
 [2017-II]
(a) Innovation and R&.D is the only way to reduce rural
to urban migration.
(b) Every rapidly growing country needs to minimize the
divergence between productivity in agriculture and
other sectors.
(c) Inclusive innovation and R&D can help create an
egalitarian society.
(d) Rapid urbanization takes place only when a country's
economic growth is rapid.
PASSAGE
Climate change is likely to expose a large number of people to
increasing environmental risks forcing them to migrate. The
international community is yet to recognize this new category of
migrants. There is no consensus on the definition and status of
climate refugees owing to the distinct meaning the term refugees
carry under international laws. There are still gaps in
understanding how climate change will work as the root cause
of migration. Even if there is recognition of climate refugees, who
is going to provide protection? More emphasis has been given
to international migration due to climate change. But there is a
need to recognize the migration of such people within the countries
also so that their problems can be addressed properly.

187. Which of the following is the most rational inference
from the above passage? [2017-II]
(a) The world will not be able to cope with large-scale
migration of climate refugees.
(b) We must find the ways and means to stop further
climate change.
(c) Climate change will be the most important reason for
the migration of people in the future.
(d) Relation between climate change and migration is
not yet properly understood.
PASSAGE
Many farmers use synthetic pesticides to kill infesting insects.
The consumption of pesticides in some of the developed
countries is touching 3000 grams/hectare. Unfortunately, there
are reports that these compounds possess inherent toxicities

Topicwise Solved PapersF138
that endanger the health of the farm operators, consumers and
the environment. Synthetic pesticides are generally persistent
in environment. Entering in food chain they destroy the microbial
diversity and cause ecologcal imbalance. Their indiscriminate
use has resulted in development of resistance among insects
to insecticides, upsetting of balance in nature and resurgence
of treated populations. Natural pest control using the botanical
pesticides is safer to the user and the environment because
they break down into harmless compounds within hours or
days in the presence of sunlight Plants with pesticidal properties
have been in nature for millions of years without any ill or
adverse effects on the ecosystem. They are easily decomposed
by many microbes common in most soils. They help in the
maintenance of biological diversity of predators and the
reduction of environmental contamination and human health
hazards. Botanical pesticides formulated from plants are
biodegradable and their use in crop protection is a practical
sustainable alternative.

PASSAGE
An air quality index (AQI) is a way to combine measurements
of multiple air pollutants into a single number or rating. This
index is ideally kept constantly updated and available in different
places The AQI is most useful when lots of pollution data are
being gathered and when pollution levels are normally, but not
always, low. In such cases, if pollution levels spike for a few
days, the public can quickly take preventive action (like staying
indoors) in response to an air quality warning. Unfortunately,
that is not urban India. Pollution levels in many large Indian
cities are so high that they remain well above any health or
regulatory standard for large part of the year. If our index stays
in the 'Red/Dangerous' region day after day, there is not much
any one can do, other than getting used to ignoring it.

190. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
(a) Our governments are not respensible enough to keep
our cities pollution free.
(b) There is absolutely no need for air quality indices in
our country.(c) Air quality index is not helpful to the residents of
many of our large cities.
(d) In every city, public awareness about pollution
problems should increase.
PASSAGE
Productive jobs are vital for growth and a good job is the best
form of inclusion. More than half of our population depends on
agriculture, but the experience of other countries suggests that
the number of people dependent on agriculture will have to
shrink if per capita incomes in agieulture are to go up
substantially. While industry is creating jobs, too many such
jobs are low-productivity non-contractual jobs in the
unorganized sector, offering low incomes, little protection, and
no benefits. Service jobs are relatively of high productivity, but
employment growth in services has been slow in recent years.

191. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
 [2017-II]
(a) We must create conditions for the faster growth of
highly productive service jobs to ensure employment
growth and inclusion."
(b) We must shift the farm workers to the highly
productive manufacturing and service sectors to
ensure the economic growth and inclusion.
(c) We must create conditions for the faster growth of
productive jobs outside of agriculture even while
improving the productivity of agriculture.
(d) We must emphasize the cultivation of high-yielding
hybrid varieties and genetically modified crops to
increase the per capita income in agriculture.
PASSAGE
A landscape-scale approach to land use can encourage greater
biodiversity outside protected areas. During hurricane 'Mitch'
in 1998, farms using ecoagricultural practices suffered 58 per
cent, 70 per cent and 99 per cent less damage in Honduras,
Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively, than farms using
conventional techniques. In Costa Rica, vegetative windbreaks
and fencerows boosted farmers' income from pasture and coffee
while also increasing bird diversity. Bee pollination is more
effective when agricultural fields are closer to natural or
seminatural habitat, a finding that matters because 87 per cent
of the world's 107 leading crops depend on animal pollinators.
In Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Colombia silvopastoral systems
that integrate trees with pastureland are improving the
sustainability of cattle production, and diversifying and
increasing farmers' income.

192. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
 [2017-II]
(a) Agricultural practices that enhance biodiversity can
often increase farm output and reduce the
Vulnerability to disasters.
(b) All the countries of the world should be encouraged
to replace ecoagriculturc with conventional
agriculture.
(c) Ecoagriculture should be permitted in protected areas
without destroying the biodiversity there.
(d) The yield of food crops will be very high if
ecoagricultural practices are adopted to cultivate
them.

The medium term challenge for Indian manufacturing is to move
from lower to higher tech sectors, from lower to higher value-
added sectors, and from lower to higher productivity sectors.
Medium tech industries are primarily capital intensive and
resource processing; and high tech industries are mainly capital
and technoloy intensive. In order to push the share of
manufacturing in overall GDP to the projected 25 per cent,
Indian manufacturing needs to capture the global market in
sectors showing a rising trend in demand. These sectors are
largely high technology and capital intensive.

193. Which among the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
 [2017-II]
(a) India's GDP displays high value added and high
productivity levels in medium tech and resource
processing industries.
(b) Promotion of capital and technology intensive
manufacturing is not possible in India.
(c) India should push up the public investments and
encourage the private investments in research and

Over the last decade, Indian agriculture has become more robust
with record production of food grains and oilseeds. Increased
procurement, consequently, has added huge stocks of food
grains in the granaries. India is one of the world's top producers

The quest for cheap and plentiful meat has resulted in factory
farms where more and more animals are squeezed into smaller
lots in cruel and shocking conditions. Such practices have
resulted in many of the world’s health pandemics such as the
avian flu. Worldwide, livestock are increasingly raised in cruel,
cramped conditions, where animals spend their short lives under
artificial light, pumped full of antibiotics and growth hormones,
until the day they are slaughtered. Meat production is water-
intensive. 15000 litres of water is needed for every kilogram of
meat compared with 3400 litres for rice, 3300 litres for eggs and
255 litres for a kilogram of potatoes.

197. What is the most rational and crucial message given by
the passage? [2018-II]
(a) Mass production of meat through industrial farming
is cheap and is suitable for providing protein nutrition
to poor countries.
(b) Meat-producing industry violates the laws against
cruelty to animals.
(c) Mass production of meat through industrial farming
is undesirable and should be stopped immediately.

A male tiger was removed from Pench Tiger Reserve and was
relocated in Panna National Park. Later, this tiger trekked toward
his home 250 miles away. The trek of this solitary tiger highlights
a crisis. Many wildlife reserves exist as islands of fragile habitat
in a vast sea of humanity, yet tigers can range over a hundred
miles, seeking prey, mates and territory. Nearly a third of India’s
tigers live outside tiger reserves, a situation that is dangerous
for both human and animal. Prey and tigers can only disperse
if there are recognized corridors of land between protected
areas to allow unmolested passage.

198. Which of the following is the most rational and crucial
message given by the passage? [2018-II]
(a) The conflict between man and wildlife cannot be
resolved, no matter what efforts we make.
(b) Safe wildlife corridors between protected areas is an
essential aspect of conservation efforts.

All actions to address climate change ultimately involve costs.
Funding is vital in order for countries like India to design and
implement adaptation and mitigation plans and projects. The
problem is more severe for developing countries like India,

its need to finance development. Most countries do indeed
treat climate change as real threat and are striving to address
it in a more comprehensive and integrated manner with the
limited resources at their disposal.

Cooking with biomass and coal in India is now recognized to
cause major health problems, with women and children in poor
populations facing the greatest risk. There are more than 10
lakh premature deaths each year from household air pollution
due to polluting cooking fuels with another 
1.5 lakh due to their
contribution to general outdoor air pollution in
the country. Although the fraction of the Indian population
using clean cooking fuels, such as LPG natural gas and
electricity, is slowly rising, the number using polluting solid
fuels as their primary cooking fuel has remained static for
nearly 30 years at about 70 crore.

201. Which of the following is the most crucial and logical

The Arctic’s vast reserves of fossil fuel, fish and minerals are
now accessible for a longer period in a year. But unlike
Antarctica, which is protected from exploitation by the Antarctic
Treaty framed during the Cold War and is not subject to territorial
claims by any country, there is no legal regime protecting the
Arctic from industrialization, especially at a time when the world
craves for more and more resources. The distinct possibility of
ice-free summer has prompted countries with Arctic coastline
to scramble for great chunks of the melting ocean.

Being a member of the WTO, India is bound by the agreements
that have been signed and ratified by its members, including
itself. According to Articlc 6 of the Agriculture Agreement,
providing minimum support prices for agricultural products is
considered distorting and is subject to limits. The subsidy
arising from ‘minimal supports’ cannot exceed 10 per cent of
the value of agricultural production for developing countries.
PDS in India entails minimum support prices and public
stockholding of food grains. It is possible that, in some years,
the subsidy to producers will exceed 10 per cent of the value
of agricultural production.

204. What is the crucial message conveyed by the above
passage? [2018-II]
(a) India should revise its PDS.
(b) India should not be a member of WTO.
(c) For India, food security collides with trade.
(d) India provides food security to its poor.

India’s educational system is modelled on the mass education
system that developed in the 19th century in Europe and later
spread around the world. The goal of the system is to condition
children as ‘good’ citizens and productive workers. This suited
the industrial age that needed the constant supply of a compliant

workforce with a narrow set of capabilities. Our educational
institutes resemble factories with bells, uniforms and batch-
processing of learners, designed to get learners to conform.
But, from an economic point of view, the environment today is

assumptions have been made: [2018-II]
1 . India continues to be a developing country
essentially due to its faulty education system.

2. Today’s learners need to acquire new-age skill-sets.

lo o k ing o u t f o r a w ay to attain that p e rf e c t b o d y . W e are all
different with respect to our ethnicity, genetics, family history,
gender, age, physical and mental and spiritual health status,
lifestyles and preferences. Thereby we also differ in what foods
we tolerate or are sensitive to. So we really cannot reduce so
many complexities into one diet or diet book. This explains the
failure of diets across the world in curbing obesity. Unless the
reasons for weight gain are well understood and addressed and
unless habits are changed permanently, no diet is likely to
succeed.

206. What is the most logical and rational inference that can
be made from the above passage? [2018-II]
(a) Obesity has become an epidemic all over the world.
(b) A lot of people are obsessed with attaining a perfect
body.
(c) Obesity is essentially an incurable disease.
(d) There is no perfect diet or one solution for obesity.

Monoculture carries great risks. A single disease or pest can
wipe out swathes of the world’s food production, an alarming
prospect given that its growing and wealthier population will
eat 70% more by 
2050. The risks are magnified by the changing
climate. As the planet warms and monsoon rains intensify,
farmlands in Asia will flood. North America will suffer more
intense droughts, and crop diseases will spread to new latitudes.

207. Which of the following is the most logical, rational and
crucial message given by the passage? [2018-II]
(a) Preserving crop genetic diversity is an insurance
against the effects of climate change.
(b) Despite great risks, monoculture is the only way
to ensure food security in the world.
(c) More and more genetically modified crops only
can save the world from impending shortages of
food.
(d) Asia and North America will be worst sufferers from
climate change and the consequent shortage of food.

It is no longer enough for us to talk about providing for
universal access to education. Making available schooling
facilities is an essential prerequisite, but is insufficient to ensure
that all children attend school and participate in the learning
process. The school may be there, but children may not attend
or they may drop out after a few months. Through school and
social mapping, we must address the entire gamut of social,
economic, cultural and indeed linguistic and pedagogic issues,
factors that prevent children from weaker sections and
disadvantaged groups, as also girls, from regularly attending
and complementing elementary education. The focus must be
on the poorest and most vulnerable since these groups are the
most disempowered and at the greatest risk of violation or
denial of their right to education.
The right to education goes beyond free and compulsory
education to include quality education for all. Quality is an
integral part of the right to education. If the education process
lacks quality, children are being denied their right. The Right
of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act lays down
that the curriculum should provide for learning through activities,
exploration and discovery. This places an obligation on us to
change our perception of children as passive receivers of
knowledge, and to move beyond the convention of using
textbooks as the basis of examinations. The teaching-learning
process must become stress-free; and a massive programme for
curricular reform should be initiated to provide for a child-
friendly learning system, that is more relevant and empowering.
Teacher accountability systems and processes must ensure
that children are learning, and that their right to learn in a child-
friendly environment is not violated. Testing and assessment
systems must be reexamined and redesigned to ensure that
these do not force children to struggle between school and
tuition centres, and bypass childhood.

208. According to the passage, which of the following is/are
of paramount importance under the Right to education?
[2018-II]

1. Sending of children to school by all parents

2. Provision of adequate physical infrastructure in schools

only three to four percent of population is engaged in agriculture,
around 47 percent of India’s population is dependent upon
agriculture. Even if India continues to do well in the service

‘Desertification’ is a term used to explain a process of decline
in the biological productivity of an ecosystem, leading to total
loss of productivity. While this phenomenon is often linked to
the arid, semi-arid and sub-humid ecosystems, even in the
humid tropics, the impact could be most dramatic.
Impoverishment of human-impacted terrestrial ecosystems may
exhibit itself in a variety of ways : accelerated erosion as in the
mountain regions of the country, salinization of land as in the
semi-arid and arid ‘green revolution’ areas of the country, e.g.,
Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, and site quality decline-a
common phenomenon due to general decline in tree cover and
monotonous monoculture of rice/wheat across the Indian plains.
A major consequence of deforestation is that it relates to adverse
alterations in the hydrology and related soil and nutrient losses.
The consequences of deforestation invariably arise out of site
degradation through erosive losses. Tropical Asia, Africa and
South America have the highest levels of erosion. The already
high rates for the tropics are increasing at an alarming rate (e.g.,
through the major river systems-Ganga and Brahmaputra, in the
Indian context). due to deforestation and ill-suited land
management practices subsequent to forest clearing. In the
mountain context, the declining moisture retention of the
mountain soils, drying up of the underground springs and
smaller rivers in the Himalayan region could be attributed to
drastic changes in the forest cover. An indirect consequence


General Comprehension F143
is drastic alteration in the upland-lowland interaction, mediated
through water. The current concern the tea planter of Assam
has is about the damage to tea plantations due to frequent
inundation along the flood -plains of Brahmaputra, and the
damage to tea plantation and the consequent loss in tea
productivity is due to rising level of the river bottom because
of siltation and the changing course of the river system. The
ultimate consequences of site desertification are soil
degradation, alteration in available water and its quality, and
the consequent decline in food, fodder and fuelwood yields
essential for the economic well-being of rural communities.

well under drought, heat, and enhanced 2CO , But the private-
sector and farmer-led process of choosing crops favours
homogeneity adapted to past or current conditions, not varieties
capable of producing consistently high yields in warmer, wetter,

needed to conserve a wider pool of genetic resources of existing
crops, breeds and their wild relatives. Relatively intact
ecosystems, such as forested catchments, mangroves, wetlands,
can buffer the Impacts of climate change. Under a changing
climate, these ecosystems are themselves at risk, and
management approaches will need to be more proactive andadaptive. Connections between natural areas, such as migration
corridors, may be needed to facilitate species movements to

India’s economic footprint, given its population, still remains small
compared to the US, the European Union or China. It has much to
learn from other economies, yet must implement solutions that fit
its unique circumstances. India especially needs an effective long-
term regulatory system based on collaboration rather than the
current top-down approach. Regulations seek desirable outcomes
yet are repeatedly used as political tools to push one agenda or
another. Often, regulations fail to consider impacts on jobs and
economic growth – or less restrictive alternatives. Regulations
may be used to protect local markets at the expense of more widely
shared prosperity in the future. Additionally, regulations inevitably
result in numerous unintended consequences. In today’s hyper
competitive global economy , regulations need to be viewed as
“weapons” that seek cost-justified social and environmental
benefits while improving the economic well-being of most citizens.

In a study , scientists compared the microbiomes of poorly
nourished and well nourished infants and young children. Gut
microbes were isolated from faecal samples of malnourished and
healthy children. The microbiome was “immature” and less diverse
in malnourished children compared to the better developed
“mature” microbiome found in healthy children of the same age.
According to some studies, the chemical composition of mother’s
milk has shown the presence of a modified sugar (sialylated
oligosaccharides). This is not utilized by the baby for its own
nutrition. However, the bacteria constituting the infant’s
microbiome thrive on this sugar which serves as their food.
Malnourished mothers have low levels of this sugar in their milk.
Consequently , the microbiomes of their infants fail to mature.
That in turn, leads to malnourished babies.
225. Which one of the following is the most logical, rational

A research team examined a long-term owl roost. Owls prey on
small mammals and the excreted remains of those meals that
accumulated over the time, provide us an insight into the
composition and structure of small mammals over the past
millennia. The research suggested that when the Earth went
through a period of rapid warming about 13,000 years ago, the
small mammal community was stable and resilient. But, from the
last quarter of the nineteenth century, human-made changes to
the environment had caused an enormous drop in biomass and
energy flow. This dramatic decline in energy flow means modern
ecosystems are not adapting as easily as they did in the past.

Food varieties extinction is happening all over the world – and it

were grown during the nineteenth century . fewer than a hundred
remain. In the Philippines, thousands of varieties of rice once
thrived; now only up to a hundred are grown there. In China, 90
percent of the wheat varieties cultivated just a century ago have
disappeared. Farmers in the past painstakingly bred and
developed crops well suited to the peculiarities of their local climate
and environment. In the recent past, our heavy dependence on a
few high yielding varieties and technology-driven production
and distribution of food is causing the dwindling of diversity in
food crops. If some mutating crop disease or future climate change
decimates the few crop plants we have come to depend on to feed
our growing population, we might desperately need some of those
varieties we have let go extinct.

What stands in the way of the widespread and careful adoption
of ‘Genetic Modification (GM)’ technology is an ‘Intellectual
Property Rights’ regime that seeks to create private monopolies
for such technologies. If GM technology is largely corporate
driven, it seeks to maximize profits and that too in the short run.
That is why corporations make major investments for herbicide-
tolerant and pest-resistant crops. Such properties have only a
short window, as soon enough, pests and weeds will evolve to
overcome such resistance. This suits the corporations. The
National Farmers Commission pointed out that priority must be
given in genetic modification to the incorporation of genes that
can help impart resistance to drought, salinity and other stresses.

Most invasive species are neither terribly successful nor very
harmful. Britain’s invasive plants are not widespread, not
spreading especially quickly , and often less of a nuisance than
vigorous natives such as bracken. The arrival of new species

cases, a flood of newcomers drives no native species to extinction.
One reason is that invaders tend to colonise disturbed habitats
like polluted lakes and post-industrial wasteland, where little else
lives. They are nature’s opportunists.

PASSAGE
Political theorists no doubt have to take history of injustice, for
example, untouchability , seriously . The concept of historical
injustice takes note of a variety of historical wrongs that continue
into the present in some form or the other and tend to resist repair.
Two reasons might account for resistance to repair. One, not only
are the roots of injustice buried deep in history , injustice itself
constitutes economic structures of exploitation, ideologies of
discrimination and modes of representation. Two, the category of
historical injustice generally extends across a number of wrongs
such as economic deprivation, social discrimination and lack of
recognition. The category is complex, not only because of the
overlap between a number of wrongs, but because one or the
other wrong, generally discrimination, tends to acquire partial
autonomy from others. This is borne out by the history of repair
in India.

237. What is the main idea that we can infer from the passage?
[2019-II]
(a) Untouchability in India has not been taken seriously
by political theorists.
(b) Historical injustice is inevitable in any society and is
always beyond repair.
(c) Social discrimination and deprivation have their roots
in bad economies.
(d) It is difficult, if not impossible, to repair every
manifestation of historical injustice.

238. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]

1. Removal of economic discrimination leads to removal
of social discrimination.

2. Democratic polity is the best way to repair historical
wrongs.
Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?
(a) 1 only (b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2
PASSAGE
Education plays a great transformatory role in life, particularly so
in this rapidly changing and globalizing world. Universities are
the custodians of the intellectual capital and promoters of culture
and specialized knowledge. Culture is an activity of thought, and
receptiveness to beauty and human feelings. A merely well
informed man is only a bore on God’s earth. What we should aim
at is producing men who possess both culture and expert
knowledge. Their expert knowledge will give them a firm ground
to start from and their culture will lead them as deep as philosophy
and as high as art. Together it will impart meaning to human
existence.

239. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]


General Comprehension F147

1. A society without well educated people cannot be
transformed into a modern society .

2. Without acquiring culture, a person’s education is not
complete.

(c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2
PASSAGE
Soil, in which nearly all our food grows, is a living resource that
takes years to form. Yet it can vanish in minutes. Each year 75
billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to erosion. That is alarming —
and not just for food producers. Soil can trap huge quantities of
carbon dioxide in the form of organic carbon and prevent it from
escaping into the atmosphere.

240. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]
1 . Large scale soil erosion is a major reason for
widespread food insecurity in the world.

2. Soil erosion is mainly anthropogenic.

3. Sustainable management of soils helps in combating
climate change.

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3
PASSAGE
Inequality is visible, even statistically measurable in many
instances, but the economic power that drives it is invisible and
not measurable. Like the force of gravity , power is the organising
principle of inequality , be it of income, or wealth, gender, race,
religion and region. Its effects are seen in a pervasive manner in
all spheres, but the ways in which economic power pulls and tilts
visible economic variables remain invisibly obscure.

241. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]

1. Economic power is the only reason for the existence of
inequality in a society .

2. Inequality of different kinds, income, wealth, etc.
reinforces power.

3. Economic power can be analysed more through its
effects than by direct empirical methods.
Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?
(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3
PASSAGE
Climate change may actually benefit some plants by lengthening
growing seasons and increasing carbon dioxide. Y et other effects
of a warmer world, such as more pests, droughts, and flooding,
will be less benign. How will the world adapt? Researchers project
that by 2050, suitable croplands for four commodities — maize,
potatoes, rice and wheat — will shift, in some cases pushing
farmers to plant new crops. Some farmlands may benefit from
warming, but others won’t. Climate alone does not dictate yields;
political shifts, global demand, and agricultural practices will
influence how farms fare in the future.

242. Which one of the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
[2019-II]
(a) Farmers who modernize their methods and diversify
their fields will be in an advantageous position in future.(b) Climate change will adversely affect the crop diversity.
(c) Shifting major crops to new croplands will lead to a
great increase in the total area under cultivation and
thus an increase in overall agricultural production.
(d) Climate change is the most important factor affecting
the agricultural economy in the future.
PASSAGE
A bat’s wings may look like sheets of skin. But underneath, a bat
has the same five fingers as an orangutan or a human, as well as
a wrist connected to the same cluster of wrist bones connected to
the same long bones of the arm. What can be more curious than
that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for
digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the
wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern?

243. Which one of the following is the most logical, scientific
and rational inference that can be made from the above
passage? [2019-II]
(a) Different species having similar structure of hands is
an example of biodiversity.
(b) Limbs being used by different species for different
kinds of work is an example of biodiversity .
(c) Man and the aforementioned animals having similar
structure of limbs is an example of coincidence in
evolution.
(d) Man and the aforementioned animals have a shared
evolutionary history .
PASSAGE
Around 56 million years ago, the Atlantic Ocean had not fully
opened and animals, perhaps including our primate ancestors,
could walk from Asia to North America through Europe and across
Greenland. Earth was warmer than it is today , but as the Palaeocene
epoch gave way to Eocene, it was about to get much warmer still
– rapidly and radically . The cause was a massive geologically
sudden release of carbon. During this period called Palaeocene –
Eocene Thermal Maximum or PETM, the carbon injected into the
atmosphere was roughly the amount that would be injected today
if humans burned all the Earth’s reserves of coal, oil and natural
gas. The PETM lasted for about 1,50,000 years, until the excess
carbon was reabsorbed. It brought on drought, floods, insect
plagues and a few extinctions. Life on Earth survived – indeed, it
prospered – but it was drastically different.

244. Based on the above passage, the following assumptions
have been made: [2019-II]

1. Global warming has a bearing on the planet’s biological
evolution.

2. Separation of land masses causes the release of huge
quantities of carbon into the atmosphere.

3. Increased warming of Earth’s atmosphere can change
the composition of its flora and fauna.

4. The present man-made global warming will finally lead
to conditions similar to those which happened 56
million years ago.
Which of the assumptions given above are valid?

Low-end IoT (Internet of Things) devices are cheap commodity
items : addressing security would add to the cost. This class of
items is proliferating with new applications; many home
appliances, thermostats, security and monitoring devices and
personal convenience devices are part of the IoT. So are fitness
trackers, certain medical implants and computer-like devices in
automobiles. The IoT is expected to expand exponentially — but
new security challenges are daunting.

245. Which one of the following statements is the most logical
and rational inference that can be made from the above
passage? [2019-II]
(a) Development of enabling technologies in India can be
a big boost to its manufacturing sector.
(b) India is not yet fully ready to adopt IoT in view of the
imminent security challenges.
(c) Life becomes more comfortable with the development
of cheap low-end IoT devices.
(d) As we go digital, we must recognise the huge threat to
Internet security from some IoT devices.
PASSAGE
With the digital phenomenon restructuring most social sectors, it
is little surprise that global trade negotiations are now eyeing the
digital area in an attempt to pre-emptively colonise it. Big Data is
freely collected or mined from developing countries, and
converted into digital intelligence in developed countries. This
intelligence begins to control different sectors and extract
monopoly rents. A large foreign company providing cab service,
for instance is not a network of cars and drivers; it is digital
intelligence about commuting, public transport, roads, traffic, city
events, personal behavioural characteristics of commuters and
drivers and so on.

246. Which one of the following is the most logical and rational
corollary to the above passage? [2019-II]
(a) Globalization is not in the interests of India as it
undermines its socio-economic structures.
(b) India should be careful to protect its digital sovereignty
in global trade talks.
(c) India should charge monopoly rents from multinational
companies in exchange for Big Data.
(d) The loss of Big Data from India is proportional to the
degree/value of its foreign trade.

247. Which of the following is most definitively implied by the
above passage? [2019-II]
(a) Big Data is the key resource in the digital space.
(b) Big economies create Big Data.
(c) Access to Big Data is the prerogative of developed
countries.
(d) Access to and possession of Big Data is a
characteristic of developed countries.
PASSAGE
The rural poor across the world, including India, have contributed
little to human-induced climate change, yet they are on the
frontline in coping with its effects. Farmers can no longer rely on
historical averages for rainfall and temperature, and the more
frequent and extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods,
can spell disaster. And there are new threats, such as sea level
rise and the impact of melting glaciers on water supply . How
significant are small farms? As many as two billion peopleworldwide depend on them for their food and livelihood. Small-
holder farmers in India produce 41 percent of the country’s food
grains, and other food items that contribute to local and national
food security.

248. What is the most logical and rational corollary to the
above passage? [2019-II]
(a) Supporting small farmers is an important part of any
agenda regarding environmentally sustainable
development.
(b) Poor countries have little role to play in the mitigation
of global warming.
(c) Due to a large number of farmer households, India will
not have food security problem in the foreseeable
future.
(d) Only small-holder farmers in India can ensure food
sec ur i t y.

249. The above passage implies that [2019-II]

1. There is a potential problem of food insecurity in India.

PASSAGE
A changing climate, and the eventual efforts of governments
(however reluctant) to deal with it, could have a big impact on
investors’ returns. Companies that produce or use large amounts
of fossil fuels will face higher taxes and regulatory burdens. Some
energy producers may find it impossible to exploit their known
reserves, and be left with “stranded assets” — deposits of oil
and coal that have to be left in the ground. Other industries could
be affected by the economic damage caused by more extreme
weather — storms, floods, heat waves and droughts.

250. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]

1. Governments and companies need to be adequately
prepared to face the climate change.

2. Extreme weather events will reduce the economic
growth of governments and companies in future.

3. Ignoring climate change is a huge risk for investors.

Access to schooling for those coming of school age is close to
universal, but access to quality exhibits a sharp gradient with
socio-economic status Quotas for the weaker sections in private
schools is a provision introduced by the Right of Children to
Free and Compulsory Education Act, 
2009. The quotas have
imposed a debate on issues of social integration and equity in
education that private actors had escaped by and large. The idea
of egalitarian education system with equality of opportunity as
its primary goal appears to be outside the space that private school
principals inhabit. Therefore, the imposition of the quotas has led
to resistance, sometimes justified.

251. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made : [2019-II]
1 . Making equality of opportunity a reality is the
fundamental goal of the Indian education system.


General Comprehension F149

2. The present Indian school system is unable to provide
egalitarian education.

3. Abolition of private schools and establishment of more
government schools is the only way to ensure
egalitarian education.

PASSAGE
A majority of the TB infected in India are poor and lack sufficient
nutrition, suitable housing and have little understanding of
prevention. TB then devastates families, makes the poor poorer,
particularly affects women and children, and leads to ostracisation
and loss of employment. The truth is that even if TB does not kill
them, hunger and poverty will. Another truth is that deep-seated
stigma, lack of counselling, expensive treatment and lack of
adequate support from provider and family , coupled with torturous
side-effects demotivate patients to continue treatment — with
disastrous health consequences. [2019-II]

252. Which one of the following is the most logical, rational
and crucial message conveyed by the above passage?
(a) TB is not a curable disease in Indian circumstances.
(b) Curing TB required more than diagnosis and medical
treatment.
(c) Government’s surveillance mechanism is deficient; and
poor people have no access to treatment.
(d) India will be free diseases like TB only when its poverty
alleviation programmes are effectively and successfully
implemented.
PASSAGE
Private investment in general is volatile. Foreign private
investment is more volatile because the available investment
avenues are significantly greater (i.e., the entire world). Therefore,
the responsibility of providing employment cannot be left to
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The current FDI inflows are
volatile over time and across sectors and regions, which is a
necessary consequence of their search for the highest returns.
The adverse consequences are unstable employment and an
accentuation of income and regional inequalities. A probable
positive consequence of foreign investment is the inflow of new
technology and its subsequent diffusion. However, the
technology diffusion is not at all certain because the existing
state of physical and human capital in India may prove inadequate
for the diffusion. [2020-II]

253. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. Relying on foreign investment in the long run is not
an economically sound policy .

2. Policies must be undertaken to reduce volatility in
foreign private investment.

3. Policies must be undertaken to strengthen domestic
private investment.

4. Public investment should be given priority over private
investment.

5. Substantial public investment in education and health
should be undertaken.

Many opportunities to harness the highly skewed, seasonal and
spatial distribution of monsoon flows, which occur in a four-
month period from June to September annually, have been lost.
Since these few months account for most of the rainfall and
consequent freshwater availability, the need for holding rainwater
in reservoirs, for subsequently releasing it for use over the year,
is a necessity nobody can afford to overlook. Climate change
will continue to affect weather conditions and create water
shortages and excesses. While millions suffer from droughts
and floods, waters in the country’s many rivers flow unutilized,
and are discharged into the sea every year. [2020-II]

254. With reference to the above passage, which of the following
could be the most rational and practical implications for
India?

1. Inter-linking of rivers should be undertaken.

2. A network of dams and canals should be built across
the country for proper distribution of water.

3. Farmers should be provided easy loans for digging
borewells.

4. Usage of water for agriculture should be regulated by

People will invest in education whenever they are granted the
economic freedom to fully enjoy its benefits. Again, this is for the
obvious reason that the return on education increases as the level
of economic freedom rises. When people, thanks to lower tax rates,
are allowed to retain most of the higher income that they gain from
each incremental level of education, it makes eminent sense to
invest in education. On the other hand, when the government
decides to tax the higher income of educated individuals at even
higher rates, it makes very little sense to invest in educating oneself
further. The same incentives apply to parents who decide on
whether to invest in their children’s education.

255. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. Lower tax rates in a country invariably translate into
greater investments in higher education.

2. Investment in the education of children ensures their
economic freedom.

3. Economic freedom has a positive impact on building
up human capital.

Our urban bodies cannot possibly ensure sustainable delivery
of water in our cities unless financing mechanisms are put in
place. Water delivery requires heavy investment in collecting it
from a natural source, treating it to make it potable, and laying a
distribution network of pipes for delivery to the users. It also
requires investments in sewerage infrastructure and sewage
treatment plants so that the sewers can carry the wastewater to

these plants to ensure that no untreated sewage is discharged
back into natural water bodies. If our cities were rich enough to
meet the entire cost, water could be delivered free. They are not.

256. What is the most logical and crucial message conveyed
by the passage?
(a) Urban local bodies must recover costs through user
charges.
(b) Urban local bodies are not efficient enough to meet
the water requirements of our cities.
(c) Water shortage in our cities is a perennial problem
that cannot be solved.
(d) In view of the water crises in our cities, there is an
urgent need to limit the population of cities by adopting
an upper limit of population size.

257. Withe reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. Rich cities only can ensure sustainable delivery of water.

2. Sustainable delivery of water in cities means much
more than supplying water to household.

PASSAGE
In India, agriculture still engages about half of its workforce, and
about 85 percent of its farms are small and marginal. Compared to
China and Vietnam, which have experienced fast structural and
rural transformation, India’s story is of slow transformation. As a
result, poverty reduction in India was at a much slower pace
during 1988–2014, compared to China and Vietnam. India’s
poverty reduction was slow during 1988–2005, but during
2005–2012, it accelerated dramatically–almost three times faster
than during the earlier period. What did India do during this
period? Research reveals that the relative price scenario changed
significantly (by more than 50%) in favour of agriculture in the
wake of rising global prices. This boosted private investments in
agriculture by more than 50%. As a result, agri-GDP growth
touched 
4.1% during 2007–2012 as against 
2.4% during
2002–
2007. The net surplus of agri-trade touched $25 billion in
2013–2014; real farm wages rose by 7% per annum. All this led to
unprecedented fall in poverty. [2020-II]

258. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. Structural and rural transformation is impossible when
farms are mainly small and marginal.

2. A good price incentive can trigger investments in
agriculture.

3. India needs to build value chains for high-value agri-
products like livestock and horticulture.

4. Higher global prices of agricultural commodities are
essential for India’s poverty reduction.

259. Which one of the following statements best reflects the
critical message of the passage?
(a) India should created large-scale off-farm rural
employment to reduce poverty in the near future.
(b) India should create a large number of farmer producer
companies.(c) Private investment in agriculture should be given
priority over public investment.
(d) Inclusive agricultural growth is key to reduce poverty
in the near future.
PASSAGE
In India, over the last decade or so, labour has been departing
agriculture, but is only going to construction and unregistered
manufacturing which are not markedly better jobs. Services,
where labour tends to be most productive, are not generating
the additional jobs the country needs. India will need 24 million
or so jobs over the next decade. The new sector, e-commerce,
can at best close only half the jobs gap. Only those sectors that
drive domestic demand such as health and education can
comfortably fill the other half. [2020-II]

260. Which one the following is best implied in the passage?
(a) Strong measures need to be taken to reduce the rural
to urban migration of labour.
(b) The working condition in construction and
unregistered manufacturing needs to be improved.
(c) Service sector has been reducing the problem of
unemployment.
(d) Increased social sector spending is imperative for
large-scale job creation.
PASSAGE
In India, the current focus on the right to privacy is based on
some new realities of the digital age. A right is a substantive right
only if it works in all situations, and for everyone. A right to free
expression for an individual about her exploitation, for instance,
is meaningless without actual availability of security that
guarantees that private force cannot be used to thwart this right.
The role of the State, therefore, is not just to abstain from
preventing rightful free expression, but also to actively ensure
that private parties are not able to block it. [2020-II]

261. On the basis of the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. State should have some institutions to ensure its
appropriate role in a digital society .

2. State should ensure that private parties do not violate
the citizens’ right to privacy .

3. Digital economy is not compatible with the idea of not
violating the citizens’ privacy .

One of the biggest ironics around water is that it comes from
rivers and other wetlands. Yet it is seen as divorced from them.
While water is used as a resource, public policy does not always
grasp that it is a part of the natural ecosystem. Efforts at
engineering water systems are thus efforts at augmenting water
supply rather than strengthening the capacities of ecological
systems. [2020-II]

262. Which one the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
(a) Rivers and other wetlands should be protected under
Ramsar Convention.
(b) Engineering water systems should be modernized and
further augmented.

Asset allocation is the most important investment decision we
will ever make, and sadly , most of us do not give that decision
the importance it deserves. We are adamant about seeking
predictability with our future. We tend to thing of investing in
risky assets as extremely volatile and value cording. We also
dislike fluctuating returns and the loss of control of investment.
We think our money is best left idle, unproductive but safe.
There is no asset that is risk-free. We could lose our jobs, our
homes can lose value, our banks can go bankrupt, our bonds
can default, the government can collapse and companies we
chose fondly may cease to exist. But we cannot live life assuming
that all these extreme events are waiting to happen, and all at the
same time. All these extreme forms of risks we know will not
manifest at the same time. [2020-II]

263. Which one of the following statements best implies the
suggestion given by the author of the passage?
(a) Distribute your wealth across different kinds of assets
so that your risks would be minimized.
(b) Risk-taking behaviour should be a necessary

Bank credit to the industrial sector has started shrinking. Its
decline has been a serious concern as credit growth is essential
to revive investment. The problem’s origins lie in the incomplete
reforms of the last 25 years. An institutional change that should
have followed the 1991 reforms should have been setting up of a
resolution corporation for banks. In a market economy with booms
and b u s ts , b ank s sho u ld b e allo w e d to b e se t u p and to f all.
Today, we cannot shut down banks because there is no proper
system to shut them down. Weak loss-making banks continue to
need more capital. [2020-II]

266. Which one of the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
(a) Indian banking system is not able to help the country
in its economic growth.
(b) Economic reforms that started in 1991 have not helped
in improving the economy to expected levels.
(c) India lacks the institutional mechanism to deal with
the failure of banks.
(d) Encouraging the foreign investments in our industrial

India has tremendous potential for solar energy. We all realize
that we have to stop burning fossil fuels to meet our energy
needs. But certain renewable resources are still going through
their cost curves and learning curves to get required amount of
output. The Indian Government has strongly committed to its
targets of reducing emissions by 33 percent by 2030, and towards
this it has initiated a strong push towards a gas-based economy
and has also invested heavily in renewable energy . However,
business housed are wary of investing too heavily in renewable
energy at a time when the technology is not yet ready. [2020-II]

267. Which one the following is the most logical and rational
inference that can be made from the above passage?
(a) India’s commitment to reduce emissions by 33% is
unlikely to achieved.
(b) India should import gas rather than invest in renewable

Genome editing is different from genome modification. Genome
editing typically involves finding the part of a plant genome that
could be changed to render it less vulnerable to disease, or resistant
to certain herbicides, or to increase yields, Researchers use
‘molecular scissors’ to dissect the genome and repair it, which is a
process that occurs naturally when plants are under attack from
diseases and can throw up new mutations that enable the plant to
survive future attacks. This evolutionary process can effectively
be speeded up now that it is possible to examine plant genomes in
detail in laboratories, and create mechanisms through which the
relevant genes can be altered very precisely. [2020-II]

269. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. Genome editing does not require the transfer of genes
from one plant to another.

2. Through genome editing, the chosen genes can be
altered precisely in a manner akin to the natural
process that helps plants to adapt to the
environmental factors.

Many people understand the connection between solid waste
management and health in terms of the consequences of
unattended heaps of dry garbage which become home for flies
and other vermin. However, there is another aspect that is not
well-understood, that is, what happens when unscientific solid
waste management combines with poor drainage and dumping
of untreated sewage into drain which are meant to carry storm
water during rains. The result is choked drains which are full of
stagnant water breeding mosquitoes, resulting in the spread of
water-borne diseases. [2020-II]

270. In the context of India, which one of the following statements
best reflects the critical message of the passage?
(a) In India, the drainage networks are not separate for
sewerage and storm water.
(b) Urban local bodies do not have enough resources and
legislative authority to deal with the problems of waste
management.
(c) Solid waste management should be integrated with
the maintenance of drainage and sewerage networks.
(d) Bad management of solid waste and sewerage systems
by our municipalities is the reason for drinking water
shortages in our cities.PASSAGE
In Part III of the Constitution, which assures people certain
fundamental rights, Article 25 proclaims that “all persons are
equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to
profess, practise and propagate religion”. What people fail to
notice is that this proclamation is prefixed with the words “subject
to public order, morality, health and to the other provisions of
this Part”, which set conditions precedent for the legal protection
of religious practices of any community . The closing words of
this prefatory rider in Article 25 virtually constitute a
subordination clause placing other fundamental rights mentioned
in Part III over and above the right to religious freedom. Among
those other fundamental rights is the right to equality before law
and equal protection of laws–assured at the outset and
elaborated in later articles to mean, inter alia, that the State shall
not deny equal protection of laws to any person or group of
persons on the basis of religion alone. [2020-II]

271. What is the most logical inference from the above passage?
(a) State shall not interfere with the religious affairs of the
citizens.
(b) Religious freedom under the Constitution is open to
State intervention.
(c) Religious freedom of the citizens is not covered under
fundamental rights.
(d) Religious practices of any community are immune to
State laws.

Spanish ships in the late 16th century first brought the potato
tuber from South America to Europe whereby in the early 19th
century, it had become a reliable backup to cereal crops,
particularly in the cold, rain-soaked soils of Ireland. The Irish
were soon almost wholly dependent on the potato as their staple
food. And they were planting primarily one prodigious variety,
the ‘Lumper’ potato, whose genetic frailty would be cruelly
exposed by the fungus ‘Phytophthora infestans’. In 1845, spores
of the deadly fungus began spreading across the country ,
destroying nearly all the Lumpers in its path. The resulting famine
killed or displaced millions. [2020-II]

The pulse variety ‘Pusa Arhar 16’ has the potential to be grown in
the paddy-growing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh
and eventually in all of India. Its yield (about 2000 kg/hectare) will
be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and
because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical
harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern. India who
currently use this technology for paddy. Most important, Arhar
straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into
the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content,
which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of Arhar,
the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a
rotovator to cut the leftover straw into pieces, which can be
ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult
with leftover paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or
ploughed back. Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of
simply burning it. [2020-II]

1. Farmers’ income will be higher with pulse cultivation
than with paddy cultivation.

2. Pulse cultivation causes less pollution as compared

In India, authorities always look to store the maximum amount of
water in reservoirs during the monsoon season, which is then
used for irrigation and generation of electricity during the summermonths. It is an internationally accepted practice that the water
level of a reservoir should be kept below a certain level before
the onset of monsoon season. This is so that when monsoon
rains come, there is space to store the excess rain water and also
so that water can be released in a regulated manner. But the
authorities store the maximum amount of water in reservoirs even
before the close of the monsoon, only to ensure greater electricity
generation and irrigation: [2020-II]

275. With reference to the above passage, the following
assumptions have been made:

1. High risks involved in holding maximum water in

Economic liberalization in India was shaped largely by the
economic problems of the government than by the economic
priorities of the people or by the long-term development
objectives. Thus, there were limitations in conception and design
which have been subsequently validated by experience. Jobless
growth, persistent poverty and rising inequality have mounted
as problems since economic liberalization began. And all these
years later, four quiet crises confront the economy; agriculture,
infrastructure, industrialization and education as constraints on
the country’s future prospects. These problems must be resolved

aspire for any kind of opportunity.
18. (c) Option (c) is the correct answer as stated in the passage
‘‘ Every civilization.....life’’

19. (c) Option (c) is correct answer as the author shows that
not only mussels are affected but other 28 species also
disappeared.

20. (d) Neither 1 nor 2 is correct as the dominant species is
the keystone species and that is sea star. The sea stars do
not live exclusively on mussels as their removal resulted in
the disappearance of further 28 species.

21. (c) Only 1 and 3 are correct statements as the Mussels are
always hard competitors for sea stars, and ‘sea stars’ are
the keystone species which influences both richness of
communities and flow of energy.

22. (c) Assumption 1 is correct as disappearance of 28 species
along with mussels. Assumption 3 is also correct according
to the passage.

23. (c) with reference to the passage, only 3 and 5 are adverse

28. (b) Only statements 1 and 2 are correct as let himself be
swept away means he does not hold his own ground.

29. (a) The passage clearly suggests that education is not
instrumentalist in its deepest sense. But the opening
sentence calls it to be functional, instrumental and utilitarian.
Thus the instrumentalist view of education is the functional
and utilitarian dimension in its purposes.

30. (c) The second part of the passage clearly states education
is not a commodity but a process of expansion and
conversion of the mind – the moral and intellectual
development. Acquiring qualifications, upward mobility and
social status are the basic utility values of education.

31. (c) Again the second part clearly states the answer. a, b &
d are the utilitarian dimensions of education. But ultimately
education leads to self-critical awareness and independence
of thought.

32. (c) The sixth lines of the passage states, "one or few individuals
may be usually resistant...". Hence, option (c) is correct.

33. (b) 1 is not correct because the passage does not talk

34. (d) The widespread use of pesticides has not waned
because the ratio of cost to benefit for the individual
agricultural producer has remained in favour of pesticide use.

35. (b) Statement 1 finds in the paragraph 
1. Statement 2 is
mentioned in the paragraph which mentions pests may
possess an enzyme that can detoxify the pesticide.

36. (c) 1 is not correct as organic farming is not mentioned in
the passage. Further the passage justifies the cost benefit
to developed countries like USA.
2 is correct. Because of this problem it becomes imperative
to use pesticides.
3 is wrong as the social and health costs have to be ignored
because of the frightening prospects of the epidemic
diseases.

37. (d) The last paragraph states that sustainability depends
on continually developing new pesticides. Option (b) states
in last line of last paragraph that pesticides are more
biodegrade.
Therefore, option (a) and (b) both imply.

38. (a) Only 1 makes sense. According to the 3rd paragraph
second line, ‘And some growth ........................... natural
resources.’ 2, 3 & 4 are irrelevant statements.

39. (a) Low carbon implies renewable source of energy which
are low on carbon and can be used and recycled. Whole
passage emphasise on use of renewable sources of energy.

40. (b) 1 is not correct as economic prosperity can raise
incomes and foster better institutions but it cannot foster
sustainable economic growth. 2 is correct. Generating
adaptive technologies can lead to a sustainable growth as
discussed in para 
2. 3 is correct. As investing on research in
adaptation will help us in better handling of the changing
climate.

41. (d) Neither statement 1 nor 2 can be inferred from the given
passage.

42. (d) Statement 1 finds support in second paragraph: As
economic/historians have explained, much of
humankind's.....world.
Statement 2 mentioned in last paragraph in the form of soviet
development plan which led to ecological backlash.
Statement 3 also mentioned in the last paragraph. Hence,
(d) is correct choice.

43. (b) The central theme of the passage is clear that adaptation
and mitigation should be integrated with development
strategies. The author is not against development but a
sustainable development what he is talking about.

44. (d) Option (a) is incorrect because the passage states that
introduction of exotic species into geographical areas may
increase biodiversity as well.
Option (b) is incorrect because it cannot say that
introduction of exotic species by man into new areas have
always and greatly altered the ecosystems. Option (c) is
incorrect because homogenization of local community
population can also occur nationally .

45. (d) The first paragraph provides that human introduce
exotic species to breed exotic species with local varieties
(producing new agricultural products), to increase
agricultural productivity (bringing pest under control) and
for beautification and landscaping (recreational
opportunities).

46. (b) The second paragraph provides that under natural
conditions homogenization is prevented on account of
natural barriers (ocean and mountain range).
47. (a) (a) This obviously the correct answer, because it is
the most practical one. It is humanly possible to smuggle
live organisms and to build highways.
(b) It is not easy nor practical to make ecosystems
sensitive. So this option is ruled out.
(c) This option is also ruled out for the above said reason.
(d) It is very difficult and quite unnecessary to ensure
new species do not have an impact on local species. So this
option is also ruled out.

48. (c) Both the statements (1) and (2) are correct.

49. (b) The first paragraph in the passage conveys the
message that the detractors of democracy are quite vocal
about that fact that a number of non-democratic
governments particularly in East Asia have successfully
achieved economic development.
Options (a), (c) and (d) are automatically ruled out.

50. (d) The second and last paragraphs illustrate the fact that
freedom and liberty are essential components of
development.

51. (c) The “constitutive” connection between democracy
and development is political freedom and democratic rights.

52. (a) The effect of FDI or Foreign Direct Investment should
be to induce competition because this is ensured in most
countries worldwide.

53. (b) (a) The first option of multinational companies
getting accustomed to domestic laws is not mentioned at
all. So, this is not the correct answer.
(b) Foreign companies may establish joint ventures with
domestic or companies may get stronger as the parent
companies merge overseas. Both options are mentioned in
the paragraph. So, this is the correct answer.
(c) Since option (1) is included this is not the right answer.
(d) Same as in (c). Moreover option (4) where foreign
companies lower costs finds no mention in the paragraph.

54. (c) The message conveyed in the passage is that it is
important to have a competition law in the country to ensure
that both domestic and foreign firms have a level playing
field.

55. (b) This is the first of the passage. Group farming helps
remove poverty , increases agricultural productivity and
secures the individual from exploitation.
There is no mention of surplus production. So the other
options are ruled out.

56. (c) The last lines of passage mentioned that "the Indian
examples of women only groups farming offer potential
benefiting women". Hence, (c) is correct choice.

57. (b) (a) There is compulsion on the transition economies
to go in for group farming. Therefore, this is not the correct
answer.
(b) The paragraph is all about the benefits of group
approach to farming. This is the right answer.
(c) Both options correct included.
(d) Both cannot be negated.

58. (c) In the Western context “deepening of democracy”
means the increased participation of the individuals in the
democratic process.
So, the other options (a), (b) and (d) are automatically
negated.

59. (b) Community-Identity seems to be the governing force
mentioned in seventh line. Therefore option (b) is correct
choice.

60. (c) The involvement of communities in the democratic
process in India has led to a silent revolution. The upper
castes held power in earlier days. This power is getting
slowly , silently and surely transferred to the subaltern
groups
In the context of this argument option (a), (b) and (d) are
ruled out.

61. (d) The passage revolves around the problem of habitat
fragmentation which poses a serious threat to biodiversity
conservation.

62. (a) When forest lands get fragmented human activities
start on the edges of these fragmented lands which results
in degradation of entire forests. Therefore continuity of the
forested landscapes and corridors should be maintained.

63. (c) The discharge of agricultural slurry into watercourses
should be restricted because watercourses do not contain
the microorganisms that can decompose organic
components of agricultural slurry . Secondly , the discharge
may lead to the eutrophication of water bodies.

64. (b) Discharged agricultural slurry has been referred to as
pollutant and decomposed slurry in soil as fertilizer.

65. (b) The pollutants are added to both the soil and water.
Soil doesn't get polluted as microorganisms convert
pollutant into fertilizer. Water is enriched with the nutrient
which flows through streams, rivers and lakes. These
nutrients are responsible for eutrophication which results in
decomposition of algal blooms.

66. (b) Cultural eutrophication will result in loss of flora and
fauna as eutrophication of water bodies do not allow oxygen
to pass through it.

67. (c) The theme of the passage is based on how the
agricultural slurry when discharged in water causes cultural
eutrophication resulting ecosystem service loss. The
magnitude of the problem has been so much that the scientists
have noticed huge 'dead zones' near big water bodies which
means destruction of aquatic life.

68. (b) Man's physical need is never going to cease as long
as man is craving for it. Desire brings along miseries. If man
doesn't realize this and keeps on doing what he is doing
then no physical help can reduce his miseries. It is man's
nature which is responsible for all the miseries. The only
solution to this is man's spiritual growth and bringing change
in his character.

69. (d) The author gives primary importance to spiritual
growth in man in eradicating human misery.

70. (c) The democracies in the west have evolved over a
period of time because of people’s participation in the
democratic process. The western democracies have
institutionalized the various instrument of governance. As
a result their democracies are far more robust than the newly
formed democracies.

71. (d) Statement 1 is incorrect.
Statement 2 is also incorrect because it can be inferred from
the first paragraph that sometimes western nations are trying
to impose democracy on non western nations but it cannot
be inferred that western countries are always trying to
impose democracy on non western.

72. (a) Statement 1 is correct as it can be inferred from the
information given in the passage that companies shall comply
with all the laws of land.

73. (a) Good corporate influence have positive influence on
the share price of the company as mentioned in last fewlines of paragraph. Corporate governance is one of criteria
for the foreign institutional investors when they decide to
buy a company.

74. (c) Malnutrition occurs due to not eating adequate
quantity of food. The knowledge of the food needs of
younger children can curb this problem.

75. (b) Taking care of a young child is often left to an older
sibling by working mothers. Public health authorities do
not find a mention in the passage hence (a) is correct.

76. (c) Policy intervention can save the farmers from
agricultural risks. Because Indian farmers are risk averse.
So they design inputs and cropping patterns to reduce risk
not to maximize their profit.

77. (b) Agricultural risks can be tackled with many strategies
like crop insurance, price stabilization, development of
varieties resistant to pests and diseases. So no single risk
specific policy is sufficient to reduce it.

78. (b) According to the passage, weak global economic
prospects and continuing uncertainties in the international
markets as well as sovereign risk concerns, particularly in
the Euro area have had their impact on the emerging market
economies.

79. (c) The Indian financial markets are affected by global
changes mainly due to the contagion of Greece’s sovereign
debt problem spreading to India.

80. (d) Since the Indian financial system is bank dominated
banks ability to withstand stress is critical to overall financial
stability .

81. (a) With further globalization, consolidation, deregulation
and diversification, risk and liquidity management assumes
more importance in the Indian banking system in future.

82. (b) When Oxygen is shut from entering the decomposition
doesn't take place completely. The Carcasses inside the
sedimentary rocks get transformed into crude oil due to
heat and pressure.

83. (c) The layers of Sedimentary rocks become thicker and
heavier due to deposition and create pressure on the marine
creatures under it, which in turn change the carcasses into
crude oil.

84. (c) The apologists of the free market system believe in the
ability of the market to self correct. Their discussions are
generally about free market operations and forces, on the
efficiency of such enterprises and their ability for self
correction.

85. (c) Ideological bias means an opinion that is of a partial
nature. Here the idea expressed in the passage is that an
unregulated market is free and competent.

86. (c ) It is clearly said that the arguments betray meaning
give away a biased opinion. So statement (1) referring to
the false ideology of capitalism is one of the options. It is
also mentioned that a more honest analysis would reflect
the resultant gross inequality. So statement (4) is also the
correct option.

87. (c) According to the passage net profits are only 
2.2% as
far as the central public sector undertakings are concerned.
So statement (2) is correct. The private sector has grown.
There is a larger base with more educated and moneyed
people around. Hence statement (3) is correct too from the
point of view of the paragraph. The role of governmental
institutions in encouraging competition among the private
sector enterprises ensures the continuing growth of this
sector. Hence, Statement (4) is also correct.


General Comprehension F157

88. (b) The rural roads should be in the domain of the public
sector only because the sparse or the little traffic in these
roads makes it impossible to make profits on the road tax or
tolls as they are called.

89. (c) The government does invest in different industrial
sectors. This is what the paragraph says. Indeed there is
governmental investment in a variety of industries from
airlines, roads, steel, and finance to industries where the
private sector plays a prominent role. For in the latter it acts
as the umpire or the regulating agency so as to create a
competitive atmosphere for the growth of entrepreneurship.

90. (a) The government acts as a regulating agency by
prescribing broad norms within which the private enterprises
can conduct their business in an atmosphere of fair and
fearless competition. That is why the government is made
the umpire in a field of business players.

91. (a) According to the passage the melting of glaciers from
the Himalayas will lead to increased run-offs or flow of
water in the next 30 years, after which it will decrease, so
statement (1) is one of the factors which will force the
shifting of location of existing crops due to climatic
conditions. Temperatures will increase by 1degree
centigrade over the same period all over the world, and the
sea level is expected to rise by 10cm, so obviously very hot
places cannot be suitable for certain crops. So statement (2)
is also correct. Due to drought conditions and monsoon
variations certain areas will give poor crop productivity. So
crop production will have to be shifted to more suitable
areas to adjust with ecological imbalances. Hence statement
(3) has to be included in the answer too.

92. (c) As India is likely to experience changed weather
patterns in the future it is important to invest in research
and development in agriculture so that it is possible to locate
and indentify the areas which will be most suitable for
different crops.

93. (c) According to the passage there should be changes in
lifestyle; especially the overuse of technology should be
stopped at all costs as stated in statement (3). There should
be less consumption of animal protein that is meat. The
FAQ or the Food Administration Organization claims that
nearly 18% of greenhouse gases are emitted from livestock.
So statement (1) is also true.

94. (a) As Indians we continue to depend on fossil fuel heavily
because of the lack of investment in research and
development in other forms of energy which are so readily
available. The lack of technological development prevents
us from harnessing the resources of wind, solar and biomass
energy, which are readily available.

95. (d) According to the passage the mitigation of greenhouse
gases cause lower air pollution, this will lead to better health
among the public, as a result there will be less expenditure
on public health as stated in statement (1); scientists have
already predicted that the emission of greenhouse gases
will have disastrous impact on climate change in the next 30
years and worst still after that. So statement (4) is also
correct.

96. (b) The essential message conveyed by the passage is
that it is absolutely essential to reduce to a very great extent
the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

97. (c) In this passage the author wants to convey that the
best way to ensure the prosperity and further economic
growth of the nation is by implementing inclusive growthwhere the benefits of growth are shared by the entire
population and not by certain segments only.

98. (c) To make the process of inclusive growth more effective
the author suggests that we should not only concentrate
on the poorer sections of society, but also ensure that the
rich and middle class stand to gain certain points. In this
way it will be possible to redistribute the economic gains
made by these sections of society to those getting left
behind.

99. (d) According to the passage eradication of poverty is
not a sufficient condition for growth. So statement (1) is
ruled out. Growth has to be treated as an instrument for
ensuring prosperity for all. But this is yet to be attained. So
India has to strive on. So statement (2) is also ruled out.

100. (b) If the price of crude oil is x and the exchange rate is y,
and if such a transparent formula is set in place by the
government the oil companies can make profits by
innovating within the rules and regulations of anti- trust
and other competition laws. To ensure greater profits they
will also have to find out ways to cut costs. So statements
(2) and (3) have been selected.

101. (a) According to the passage private oil companies can
re-enter the oil producing market if a transparent rule based
petrol pricing exists because they will be able to innovate,
cut their costs and earn more profits which is an attractive
incentive for any business.

102. (d) According to the passage due to the adverse impact
of climatic change on the ecosystem can be a possible loss
of certain species of animals and their habitats and also a
decrease in the services of the ecosystem. (d) option is
correct.

103. (b) The passage clearly states that the climatic change
may have an adverse effect on the Himalayan ecosystem,
by altering temperatures, changing precipitation patterns ,
leading to drought and consequently the death of several
species of animals and plants including humans.

104. (b) The most important message conveyed in the passage
is summed up in the last few lines. The idea is to shift the
attention from merely the species-habitat focus to the entire
biographical range meaning all the plants and animals
including humans so that climatic adjustments can be taken
care of more effectively.

105. (b) It is clear from the passage that not only human activity
is causing environmental pollution, but also natural reasons
can adversely affect climate systems. This is clearly stated
in the first four lines of the passage.

106. (a) According to the passage government interference
leads to distortions and inefficiency in the economy in the
sense that there is room for corruption as well as a lack of
interest in investment on the part of the entrepreneurs.

107. (c) The first paragraph states that the basic philosophy
of globalization is to ensure absolute freedom for the markets,
to set their prices, produce their goods, and distribute them as
per their own criterion.

108. (c) The passage clearly states that in accordance with the
conditions set by the WTO. etc. for globalization, public
sectors should be privatized. So statement (1) is correct.
Employment and wages should be conditioned by the free
play of the market forces involved, otherwise it might
discourage investment as stated in statement (3). Even social
services like heath and education should welcome private
players as is correctly expressed in statement (4).

Topicwise Solved PapersF158

109. (b) The entire passage focuses on the fact that the state
should play a reducing role in the process of globalization.
This is elaborated in the last few lines of the passage with
particular reference to India.

110. (a) (a) is correct as this assumption is inherent in the
first part of the passage which says that the richer states,
having grown, have the capability to share India's burden
of becoming eco-friendly.
(b) is absurd as nowhere the passage talks about poor
states being dependent on rich States for electricity.
(c) is wrong as clean energy projects are more expensive
than the traditional fossil fuels.
(c) is wrong as the major cause of high carbon emissions in
India is development using cheaper energy sources which
have higher carbon emissions.

111. (d) (a) is wrong as the passage is not at all related to
Male chauvinism and infidelity
(b) is wrong as Love and betrayal is not the issue the
passage is trying to sentitise about. The passage is more
about a mother's influence on her child. How she governed
his life?
(c) is wrong as the passage is not at all related to Lack of
legal safeguards for women. Guleri hadn't gone for any such
protection.
(d) is correct as discussed in the paragraph. The real reason
behind this situation was Manak's mother. He could not
realise her wife's love as he was under the influence of her
mother's mindset.

112. (b) (a) is wrong as the passage does not talk about social
and political freedom rather it talks about social security.
(b) is correct as it talks about absolute social security to
all the citizens which is the essence of the passage. Refer the
1st sentence, 'to free every man from fear, that. he may live in all
possible security .'
(c) is wrong as the passage does not talk about absolute
liberty in all matters of life rather it calls to develop the
citizen's minds and bodies in security. Refer last sentence.
(d) is wrong as the passage talk about absolute security
and not just physical security as 'all possible security'
mentioned in 1st sentence refers to physical and mental (refer
last sentence) security.

113. (b) (a) is wrong as the passage does not talk about
organisational expansion of municipal bodies all over the
country .
(b) is correct as the passage clearly talks about lack of
adequate staff with required skills and competencies in the
municipal corporations or local government bodies and that
these skills are very much required as the operations are
quite complex. Hence, the assumption that our cities can
provide better quality of life with quality staff is clearly
marked out.
(c) is wrong as the passage does not talk about the
reasons for the lack of skilled staff.
(d) is wrong as the demographic dividend and the
problems associated with rapid urbanization are out of
context of the passage.

114. (c) (a), (b) and (d) are wrong as they talk about birds in
general. The passage talks specifically about Flamingos.
(c) is correct as it talks about some species of birds.

115. (d) ( a) is wrong as it is out of context of the passage.
Further extended MGNREGS only to those who have a bank
account would go against the very essence of the scheme.(b) is wrong in spite of the paper-based system of
payments being more efficient than electronic payment
system. This is not the main message of the passage.
(c) is wrong as it negates the fact mentioned in the passage.
Refer the second sentence which says, 'electronic wage
payments in MGNREGS are meant to go directly to the poor.'
(d) is absolutely correct as the opening sentence clearly
says that citizens living in rural areas, are financially illiterate.
So, it is essential to provide financial literacy to the rural
poor.

116. (c) 3 is wrong as the passage does not talk about focusing
only on human development. It do talks about an unbalanced
emphasis on growth but that, in any case, does not mean
focusing only on human development.
2 is absolutely correct as the passage clearly says an
unbalanced emphasis on growth is often associated with
negative environmental consequences and adverse
distributional effects.
1 is wrong as it is completely out of context of the passage.

117. (b) 1 is wrong as the passage nowhere talks about
economic disparity rather it talks about health, education or
other non-income aspects of human development. The
passage is essentially about drawing a balance between
economic growth and human development.
2 is the correct assumption as unbalanced growth sometimes
leads to environmental degradation.

118. (a) (a) is not or least essential as a part of the argument
because it is irrelevant in the context of the passage.
(b) is essential as a part of the argument as the 'super' and
'sub' human beings refers to the 'few select citizens' and the
'excluded ones'..
(c) is essential as a part of the argument as the second
sentence clearly says this.
(d) is essential as the recognition of disparities in
individual capacities leads to the exclusion policies.

119. (d) (a) is wrong as it states a fact mentioned in the
passage. It does not sum up the passage.
(b) is wrong as the passage does not restrict the problem
to the developing countries only .
(c) is wrong as the passage only says that the food
production will have to double. It does not talk about food
scarcity at all. Rather it talks about how to meet the required
target.
(d) correctly sums up the passage. Food security is
increasingly a collective challenge and the passage
suggests means to combat it.

120. (b) (a) is wrong as the passage says that if we can cut
our defence expenses we can find peace or building of
weapons systems by us will instigated our neighbours to
wage wars against us is a false propagation.
(b) is correct as the passage supports weapon-building
by India. It can also be inferred from the passage that India
wants to establish peace with our neighbours. So 'weapon-
building would lessen the possibility of armed conflict with
our neighbours' is the most valid assumption.
Although (c) is also an assumption but use of the
words'state of the art'and'national security' does not make
it the most valid assumption.
(d) is an inference but not an assumption.

121. (c) The questions asks for the critical inference. (d) is a
wrong as it presents a contradictory logic as mentioned in
the passage. (a) and (b) are correct statements in the context


General Comprehension F159
of the passage but they present only logical part of the
passage. Only (c) presents the most critical inference as it
highlights the problem and the solutions mentioned in the
passage.

122. (b) The passage talks about the preserved and processed
foods or the Food processing industry and the various
impacts it produces-pollution, wastage of food and rain
forests, reduced nutritional content, increased demand for
preservation and packaging. All this leads to put a burden
on our natural resources. So 2 is true. 1 is not correct as the
passage does not talk about the regionally grown food. It
talks about regions with good produce feeding other parts of
the world leaving their own region hungry . So 1 is not correct.

123. (a) The first six sentences of the passage clearly answers
the question. (b), (c) and (d) are clearly mentioned in these
sentences. It is not mentioned that the author has no
intention to waste his time but what is mentioned is that his
constitutional shyness saves or spares him a lot of time.

124. (a) The first half or the first 7-8 sentences of the passage
clearly explains the shyness of the author or his hesitancy
in speech which has restrainedhis thoughts. As a result, no
thought less word is uttered from himwhile speaking or
writing and hence, he has never regrettedhis speech or
writing. This has spared him from many a mishap and waste
of time. Immense patience and spiritual person cannot be
related to him at all. The author sarcastically mentions that
'silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of
truth'.So, (a) is correct answer.

125. (d) The 10th sentence of the passage 'Proneness to
exaggerate, to _______ in order to surmount it' clearly
suggests 'tendency to overstate' as the answer. So, (d) is
correct answer.

126. (d) The passage clearly talks about the high inflation in
India and its inability to contain it due to the innumerable
external factors which are a result of the economic reforms.
So (d) is correct.
(a) is wrong as it talks about avoiding all trade liberalisation
policies and all subsidies which is more of a solution of the
problem of inflation but not a message of the passage.
(b) is wrong as it talks about reasons for India's non-
readiness to take up the trade liberalisation process. It is
out of scope of the passage.
(c) is wrong as the passage does not talk about poverty
at all.

127. (d)
(a) is wrong as it negates the basic premise of the passage.
According to the passage 'No Right is absolute, exclusive or
inviolable whereas (a) says that The Right of personal property
is a Natural Right.
(b) is wrong as it presents another extreme stand on
Personal property by equating it to theft and an instrument
of exploitation. It misses out the assumed legitimacy of the
right and does not see it in the context.
(c) is wrong as it talks about The Right of personal
property being violative of distributive justice and negating
the principle of cooperation. It does not explain the
argument.
(d) is correct as it clearly explains the argument by
mentioning that the Right of each person to acquisition of
property has to be reconciled with that of others.Refer the
principle of cooperation mentioned in the last sentence.N o t e : Economic justice, which touches the individual
person as well as the social order, encompasses the moral
principles which guide us in designing our economic
institutions. These institutions determine how each person
earns a living, enters into contracts, exchanges goods and
services with others and otherwise produces an
independent material foundation for his or her economic
sustenance. The ultimate purpose of economic justice is to
free each person to engage creatively in the unlimited work
beyond economics, that of the mind and the spirit.
The Three Principles of Economic Justice: Like every
system, economic justice involves input, output, and
feedback for restoring harmony or balance between input
and output. Within the system of economic justice as
defined by Louis Kelso and Mortimer Adler, there are three
essential and interdependent principles: Participative
Justice (the input principle), Distributive Justice (the out-
take principle), and Social Justice (the feedback principle).
Like the legs of a three-legged stool, if any of these
principles is weakened or missing, the system of economic
justice will collapse.
 

128. (a) (a) is correct as the passage talks about the conflict
between man and State. Moreover, the passage confirms
that this is a continuous tussle and is as old as the state
history . The solution seems to be' still far off suggests that
the conflict will remain unresolved.
(b) and (d) are wrong as they present only the idea contained
in the last line of the passage.
(c) is wrong as the passage clearly mentions that old values
and ideas constantly yield place to new ones which is
contrary to what is mentioned in (c). Moreover, it is not the
author's viewpoint.

129. (c) The passage clearly talks about 1 and 
3. Refer the 4th
sentence, 'The scale and magnitude of the financial support
______ multilateral negotiations under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)',
which mentions 1 and 3 both. Crop failure, which is an effect
of climate change, is not mentioned in the passage.

130. (c) Refer the 5th sentence, 'The Convention squarely puts
the _______ stock of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the
atmosphere', which clearly mentions 
3. 1 and 2 are not
mentioned in the passage.

131. (a) Refer the second last sentence, 'Given the magnitude
of the task and the funds required, domestic finances are
likely to fall short of the current and projected needs of the
developing countries', which clearly shows that climate
change is likely to have implications on their domestic
finances. 2 is not mentioned in the passage.

Topicwise Solved PapersF160

132. (a) The passage clearly depicts the tussle between
developed and developing countries regarding support for
mitigation. The developing nations need financial support
to adapt to the new measures and they want the developed
nations to bear the expense of what they have caused. (b),
(c) and (d) are wrong because the passage does not mention
either of exploitation of natural resources, Lack of political
will or Governance problems.

133. (b) A corollary is a proposition that follows from one
already proved. (b) is the most appropriate as the passage
clearly states that poverty and climate impacts reinforce
each other. Poverty leads to climate deterioration (due to
unsustainable use of resources, refer last line) and climate
change leads to poverty.
(a) and (c) are wrong as they talk about poverty alleviation,
increase in food subsidies, etc. in alienation. They have got
nothing to do with climate change.
(d) is wrong as it suggests solution to curb climate change
(stop unsustainable agricultural practices) and poverty (control
food prices). It does not talk about their inter-dependence.

134. (d) The passage asks for the most rational and critical
inference from the passage. (a) is wrong as it just portrays
one part of the passage. The portfolio investments have
both the good and bad effects. (b) is wrong as the passage
suggests threat from the portfolio investments. It cannot
be stated from the passage that advanced economies will
always undermine the global financial stability . There are a
lot of other external factors working simultaneously . For
similar reasons (c) is wrong. (d) is the most rational and
critical inference as portfolio investments definitely impacts
emerging economies in certain cases so there is a risk.
Note : Portfolio investments: Portfolio investments are passive
investments, as they do not entail active management or
control of the issuing company . Rather, the purpose of the
investment is solely financial gain. This is in contrast to foreign
direct investment (FDI), which allows an investor to exercise a
certain degree of managerial control over a company . For
international transactions, equity investments where the
owner holds less than 10% of a company's shares are classified
as portfolio investments. These transactions are also referred
to as "portfolio flows" and are recorded in the financial account
of a country's balance of payments.Portfolio investments
include transactions in equity securities, such as common
stock, and debt securities, such as banknotes, bonds, and
debentures.
Quantitative Easing: Quantitative easing (QE) is a type of
monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the
economy when standard monetary policy has become
ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing
by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other
financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those
financial assets and lowering their yield, while
simultaneously increasing the money supply . This differs
from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term
government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a
specified target value.
Quantitative easing can help ensure that inflation does not
fall below a target. Risks include the policy being more
effective than intended in acting against deflation (leading
to higher inflation in the longer term, due to increased
money supply), or not being effective enough if banks do
not lend out the additional reserves.
135. (b) (a) is out of context of the passage. The passage
does not talk about resources to afford a latrine for each
household.
(c) is wrong as the passage does not talk about the
reduction of the human capital of India's workforce.
(d) is wrong as the passage suggests open defecation as
a public health problem in India. Refer last 3rd sentence,
'Diarrhoea leaves Indians' bodies smaller on average than
those of people in some poorer countries where people eat
fewer calories.'
(b) is the most critical inference as it has severe effects -
malnourishment, diarrhoea, underweight mothers-on a huge
Indian population and needs immediate attention.

136. (b) (a) is wrong as it is a general statement and does
present the crux of the passage.
(c) is wrong as the opening line of the passage says that
people talk about democracy (or understand democracy)
but they have a weakness favouring their caste or
community or religion.
(d) is wrong as it projects an extreme situation which is
out of the scope of the passage.
(b) is the most appropriate statement as it talks about
providing equal opportunities to all irrespective of the caste
or community or religion. That's what is a True democracy .

137. (b) Clearly only 2 is correct. 1 is wrong as the passage
says that 'Such access is not always available to all people
in developing countries like India and more so, in rural areas.'
This means that they are sometimes available.2 is correct as
mentioned in the last sentence of the passage.

138. (d) The crucial message conveyed in the passage is to
promote financial inclusion such that every citizen of the
country has access to bank accounts and can save money
so as to have better finances . Establishing more banks is a
route to financial inclusion. Increasing the interest rate of
bank deposits would promote savings. So (d) is correct.

139. (b) (a) is clearly wrong as the passage nowhere talks
about discretionary power in all matters of administration.
It talks about certain situations mentioned in the 1st
sentence.
(b) is correct as the passage talks about the supremacy of
rules and safeguards, refer last sentence. Further the 3rd
sentence, 'Where discretion has to be ................ misuse of
that power'reinforces the prevalence of rules and safeguards
as opposed to the influence of exclusive discretion of
authority .
(c) is wrong as it negates what the passage mean by
Parliamentary democracy-authorized by the people.

140. (c) Greater transparency in the functioning of the
government and promoting the financial inclusion is
mandatory because there have been instances where the
elite are receiving land and natural resources by bribing the
politicians. The middle class continues to struggle and is
deprived of opportunity or economic development.

141. (d) Climatic adaptation is relative to many vital factors. So
while formulating policies, the other parameters need to be
simultaneously evaluated with respect to the climatic
adaptation.

142. (a) Biodiversity is an important aspect of our ecosystem.
Given that water is an essential component of our existence,
it is subjected through many organisms before we get to sip
a glass. Thus, water is naturally recycled with the help of
the biodiversity .


General Comprehension F161

143. (d) The biggest problem in our country is the disparity in
the financial status of the citizens. For instance, all the wealth
is mostly accumulated by the elite class and the upper-middle
class. However, the poor continues to be deprived and
exploited. The banking sector should look forward to promote
financial inclusion, for equal distribution of financial services.

144. (b) Manual scavenging needs to be addressed. However,
campaigns and awareness programmes are needed to be
conducted, especially targeting the female counterparts, to
address issues related to sanitation hazards; manual
scavenging being a part of it.

145. (d) The various needs and demands of man compelled
him to creating a society , as these needs could not have
been achieved individually .

environmental pollution, organic farming should be
implemented as an alternative, for environmental
conservation.

148. (a)

practice, and subsequent follow up of the same. In this
case, a particular modification in the food habit of the cattle
herders resulted in a massive change in the genetic
constitution.

150. (d) According to the author, the national output has to
pass through the commercial channels, before consumption,
lacking which would lead to loss of income, leading to
underdevelopment and economic disparity.

151. (d) Due to the Greenhouse effect and soil pollution, a chain
reaction has led to excessive carbon deposition and
contamination. Afforestation would lead to the carbon
breakdown and release the trapped carbon back to the
atmosphere.

152. (b) The passage suggests the biggest hurdle in the world
agriculture is to maintain a demand-supply equilibrium.
Based on the relevant information provided in the passage,
it can be ascertained that regulating the pricing component
for ensuring affordability to the poor and a proper marketing
mix would be beneficial.

153. (d) The biggest challenge that has always haunted world
agriculture is to achieve a balance the demand and supply
for foods.

154. (c) To reduce hunger and starvation, ensuring equilibrium
between demand and supply of food is mandatory, alongside
ushering measures for Purchasing Power Parity, to help the
poor consumers too.

155. (b) Since there is disparity in the sustainable provision
and supply for food worldwide, this issue has gained
significance.

156. (c) The key responsibility areas of the civil service officers
need to be clearly defined and standardized, based on the
political agendas. Lack of such clarity would lead to
misgovernance. Also, striking equilibrium between external
and internal accountabilities is mandatory for effective
management.

157. (d) The passage does not provide relevant information
on either of the provided options.
158. (d) Civil services, being an extremely reputed taskforce,
should implement reforms to create benchmark in service
and improve accountability of the office bearers.

159. (d) Seeking accountability through increased participation
by individuals in the decision making process would not
help increase internal accountability .

160. (a) Religious traditions, regardless of felicitating the
Almighty or the Supernatural, ushers belief, ethics and a
specific code of conduct in the society. Man being a social
animal derives the value set from the society , important for
maintaining relationships and goodwill. Thus, human
relationships can be assumed to have been derived from
the religious traditions.

161. (c) Fundamental rights, combined with duties, are
mandatory for dispensing justice in a society .

162. (d) As per the passage, all the three options pose
challenges to the utilization of biomass as fuel. Issues related
to climatic variations, aggravation of carbon emissions due
to liquid bio-fuels and competition between biomass and
food production, have adverse effects.

163. (b) It is stated that unscrupulous cultivation of energy crops
will lead to an unhealthy competition with food crops, thereby
contributing to inflation and price hike for food crops.

164. (b) Technological intervention, with proper monitoring,
could assist in using biomass for power generation and
achieving negative emissions.

165. (a) As per the information provided in the 2nd paragraph,
some energy models (unproven technology) might negate
carbon emissions, thereby mitigating environmental
pollution due to the greenhouse effect.

166. (d) Green Revolution has its disadvantages. Biodiversity
is already at stake. Crops exposed to excessive chemicals or
the genetically modified foods lack in nutritional content, in
spite of boosting the yield. However, considering the long
term aspect, green revolution could risk quality and health.

water to drink and for their household works and so, wecan’t afford to lose such huge amount of water on producing
meat in farms thus, it can be said that environmental cost
of meat production is unsustainable when it is produced
through industrial farming.

198. (b) It is clearly mentioned in the last line of the passage.

199. (a) It is mentioned in the passage how a male tiger that
was relocated in Panna National Park trekked toward its
home 250 miles away; and that nearly a third of India’s
tigers live outside tiger reserves. These points indicate
that though initiatives have been taken for the conservation
of wildlife by relocating them, they have not been often
successful. The passage does not say anything about any
legistation in this regard.

200. (c) The passage clearly mentions that ‘most countries’
are ‘striving’ to address climate change threat. So, it is a
complex policy issue and development issue for all. So, 1 is
not valid but 2 is.
Assumption 3 can be made from, ‘the problem is more severe
........... finance development. So, the right option is (c).

201. (d) The passage states the fact that household air
pollution is hazardous to health of the people living in
poor areas to such an extent that more than 10 lakh
premature deaths occur every year due to it So, it would be
appropriate to say that the access to cooking gas can
reduce premature deaths in poor households.

202. (c) It is clearly mentioned in the second sentence of the
passage.

203. (b) It is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage
that the distinct possibility of ice-free summer has prompted
countries with Arctic coastline to rush to get larger part of
the Arctic which thereby leads to changes in the geopolitics.

204. (a) The passage conveys the facts that India provides
food security to its poor which collides with its trade. But
being a signatory of WTO, it has to revise its PDS, Option
(b) is not conveyed.

205. (b) As per the last sentence of the passage, today’s
educational system is very different i.e. it is a complex,
volatile and globally interconnected world; thus, in order
to meet these, today’s learners need to acquire new-age
skill-sets. Assumptions 1 and 3 cannot be made from the
passage.

206. (d) The passage conveys that individuals differ in many
respects and ‘we cannot reduce so many complexities’ into
one copybook diet plan. So, there is no perfect solution.
Options (a), (b) and (c) mention only one aspect each of
the discussion and none qualifies as a rational inference.

207. (a) Crop genetic diversification consists in raising a variety
of crops depending on suitability to seasonal variations of
rainfall and temperatures; and reduces susceptibility to
natural disasters like flooding and windstorm, etc., in case
of monoculture. Therefore, preserving crop diversity is an
insurance against the effects of climate change. Sentence
one declares that monoculture carries risk; so, (a) follows.

208. (c) The opening line of the passage says that ‘universal
access to education’ is no longer enough. So, 1 is not of
paramount importance. The second sentence says that ‘fa-
cilities’ or infrastructure is a prerequisite but ‘insufficient’ to
fulfil the purpose of education So, 2 is not of paramount
importance.
3 is mentioned in the second paragraph as being of para-
mount importance.


General Comprehension F163

209. (d) Assumption 1 can be made from the sentence, ‘Teacher
accountability systems...
Assumption 2 follows from ‘universal access to education’
in the opening line.
Assumption 3 follows from, ‘we must address the entire gamut
...,’ which implies that India’s ‘demographic dividend’ or ‘huge
young population across diversities’ could be tapped.

210. (d) It is clearly mentioned in the first half of the second
paragraph of the passage.

211. (c) The entire passage emphasises on giving quality
education to all children. Options (a), (b) and (d) are true, but
none conveys the essential message of the passage.

212. (b) It is stated in the passage that presently , around 47
percent of India’s population is dependent on agriculture
and it is also expected that around 2030, nearly 42 percent
of India’s population will still be predominantly dependent
on agriculture. Therefore, considering these large
percentages, it can be inferred that Indian economy greatly
depends on its agriculture.

213. (a) It can be inferred from the line ... rapid globalisation of
food... and trace? of the passage.

214. (b) The author states that there are some questions that
science cannot really answer while faith provides a better
path to answer. Thus, it can be inferred that science and
faith can be mutually complementary if their proper domains
are understood. Moreover, rest of the options apart from
option (b) are irrelevant in the context of the passage.

215. (d) It can be inferred from the first sentence of the passage
especially from the part ‘ India should rid herself
..........development of the body and the spirit’.

216. (d) All the given options are the consequences of decline
in forest cover; these can be inferred from the following
lines of the passage – “leading to total loss of productivity”,
“accelerated erosion as in the mountain regions of the
country”, “adverse alterations in the hydrology and related
soil and nutrient losses” and “drying up of the underground
springs and smaller rivers in the Himalayan region.......”.

217. (a) Statement 1 can be drawn from the sentence, ‘The
current.....and the changing course of the river system’.
The sentence, ‘Impoverishment of human
impacted...salinization of land...’ does not clarify that only
human activities cause salinisation of soil. There may be
natural causes too. The passage mentions that Tropical
Asia, Africa and South America have the highest levels of
erosion as a consequence of deforestation. Monoculture
is mentioned only in the context of Indian plains.
So, only statement 1 is a correct inference.

218. (b) Assumption 1 is invalid with reference to the line,
‘while this phenomenon .... dramatic’ which indicates that
the phenomenon is not limited to the tropical areas.
Assumption 2 is valid as the passage mentions
‘desertification’ and ‘inundation’ as the effects of
deforestation.

219. (b) All the points are mentioned in the passage except point
3; these can be inferred from the following lines of the passage
– “Accelerated breeding programs are needed to conserve a
wider pool of genetic resources of existing crops”, “Relatively
intact ecosystem, such as forest catchments, mangroves,
wetlands.....” and “Connections between natural areas, such
as migration corridors...”.

220. (b) It can be assumed from the discussion of ‘monoculture’
in the first half of the passage.
221. (c) It can be inferred from the line “If the aspirations are
more like the frugal ones we had after the Second World
War, a lot more is possible than if we view the planet as a
giant shopping mall”.

222. (b) It is clearly mentioned in the passage in the line “This
theory is false, for the art of leadership can be acquired and
can indeed be taught”.

223. (b) The passage says that India needs a collaborative
system of regulations aimed at widely shared prosperity
instead of protecting local market at its expense. Refer to
the last sentence. The word 'weapons' points to a
strategic use of regulations that seek cost-justified
benefits and overall well-being.

224. (b) The passage says that regulations are used to protect
local markets ignoring wider prosperity. So, 1 is not correct.
The last sentence of the passage hints that cost-
effectiveness and social, environmental, and
economical concerns are often ignored while
implementing regulations.

225. (d) That malnutrition is untreatable is not stated in the
passage; mature microbiomes injected into babies' guts is
a medical aberration; and, dairy milk cannot
substitute for mother's milk. However, research on the
benign effects of gut bacteria can form the basis of
government policies on food and nutrition.

226. (b) A s s u mp tio n 1 is no t v alid as the p as s ag e d o e s no t
imply probiotic as a solution to treat malnourished babies.
Assumption 2 is clear from the passage and very much
valid.

227. (d) Assumption 1 follows from the first sentence of the
passage. Assumption 2 follows from the last sentence of
the passage, '...increased levels of suspended
sediments...'. Assumption 3 clearly follows from the 2nd
sentence, 'Researchers have now found...'

228. (b) Assumption 1 is invalid as the current phase of
global warming and that which occurred 13000 years ago
do not make it a frequently occurring phenomenon.
Assumption 2 is contradictory to what the passage states.
Only assumption 3 is clear from the passage which says
that the small mammal community was stable and resistant
during the rapid warming 13000 years ago but in the
present phase of warming, they are not
adapting as easily.

229. (b) The passage argues that growing and consuming
crops suited to 'peculiarities of their local climate and
environment' ensured crop diversity in the past; while
'...our heavy dependence on a few high yielding
varieties and technology driven production and
distribution of food is causing the dwindling of
diversity in food crops.'

230. (a) The passage mentions, 'The National Farmers
Commission pointed out that priority must be given' to
more important 'stresses'.

231. (a) Assumption 1 is clearly based on the last sentence
of the passage. Assumption 2 cannot be assumed; it is
rather far-fetched.

232. (a) The passage states that invasive species are not
harmful, and 'the arrival of new species almost always
increases biological diversity in a region'.

233. (a) Assumption 1 is clear from 'there are myriad factors
that need regulation and monitoring'; Assumption 2 follows
from 'Considering the proportion of. . .'

Topicwise Solved PapersF164

234. (d) The passage states that planning is outdated;
'distanced from people's live experiences and needs' and
exclusive of participation of 'people, places, activities and
practices integral to the cities.' This implies that it favours
participation.

235. (a) The passage says that growth in employment in
organised sector is not at par with the growth in economy.
So, 1 and 2 are correct.

236. (c) The passage states that banking correspondents
'help bring people in the hinterland into the banking fold';
yet 'India's banking regulator has restricted them to serving
only one bank, perhaps to prevent arbitrage'. It argues
that efforts at banking outreach may succeed if they
'ensure not just bank accounts but also
products such as accident and life insurance and micro
pension schemes'.

237. (d) The passage says that historical injustice has deep
roots ,and constitutes exploitation, discrimination and
different 'modes of representation'; and 'generally
extends across a number of wrongs'. So, it is difficult to
repair every manifestation of it.

238. (d) It follows from explanation in Answer no.53 that
neither 'removal of economic discrimination' nor '
democratic polity' can be the only way to end injustice.

239. (b) Assumption 1 is out of context; 2 clearly follows
from the passage.

240. (d) Assumption 1clearly follows from the first three
sentences; 2 is right because though wind or harsh
climatic conditions cause soil erosion, overpopulation
resulting in excessive grazing, cropping and
deforestation accelerate it; and, 3 follows from the last
sentence of the passage.

241. (c) The passage says that all inequality is driven by
economic power; but while the former is measurable, the
latter isn't. So, Assumption 1 is valid; but, 2 is
reverse of what is stated in the passage. As the effects
of economic power 'are seen in a pervasive manner in all
spheres', assumption 3 also holds true.

242. (a) The passage says that climate change, political shifts,
global demand, and agricultural practices will
influence how farms fare in the future. So, farmers who
adapt, modernize and diversify will benefit.

243. (d) Limbs of various species showing same pattern of
construction clearly points to same process of
evolution undergone by all.

244. (c) Assumption 2 is invalid as the passage does not
relate the event of separation of landmasses with release
of carbon; 4 is invalid as the passage does not predict
this.

245. (d) The last sentence of the passage sums up the
discussion and gives the most logical inference of the
passage.

246. (b) The opening sentence of the passage talks of the
threat from developed countries who look to mining Big
Data from developing countries to create digital intelligence
and control different sectors of global trade. Therefore (b)
is the most rational corollary to the passage.

247. (a) Refer to the explanation in answer no. 
74.

248. (a) 'Farmers can no longer rely on historical averages for
rainfall and temperature' ; extreme weather events, such as
droughts and floods are more frequent and can spelldisaster; much land is lost to sea level rise and melting
glaciers have impacted water supply. So, supporting small
farmers who contribute 41 per cent to food security is
indispensable for environmentally sustainable
development.

249. (c) Assumption 1 follows from call for support to small
farmers; 2 is valid as a part of support to poor farmers.

250. (c) According to the passage, climate change and
extreme weather events caused by it and the government's
efforts to deal with it all affects investors and their
companies. Assumptions 1 and 3 are valid on this basis.
Assumption 2 is invalid because governments and
companies relentlessly upgrade efforts to counter the
challenges of climate change.

251. (a) The passage states that with the idea of egalitarian
education system with equality of opportunity as its
primary goal Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 has forced private schools to keep
quotas for weaker sections; and sometimes faces resistance
which may be justified. So, assumptions 1 and 2 are valid.
Assumption 3 is invalid as the passage doesn't hint
abolition of private schools.

252. (b) The passage argues that diagnosis and medical
treatment of TB is available in India, but hunger and
poverty, lack of awareness as well as counselling, deep-
seated stigma, inadequate support from family and
providers, and expensive medical care forces patients to
discontinue treatment.

253. (d) According to the passage, policies must be undertaken
to strengthen domestic private investment.

254. (a) The given passage stresses on the need of
undertaking of inter-linking of rivers. It can also be assumed
from the passage that for proper distribution of water, there
should be a network of dams and canals across the country.

255. (a) The passage clearly indicates that the lower tax rates
in a country always interpret the greater investments in
higher education.

256. (b) From the given passage, it can be assumed that urban
local bodies are not efficient enough to meet the water
requirements of our cities.

257. (b) The assumption that only rich cities can ensure
sustainable delivery of water is not adequate. However,
sustainable delivery of water in cities does not mean just
supplying water to households.

258. (b) A good price incentive can trigger investments in
agriculture can easily be assumed from the passage. Further,
higher global prices of agriculture commodities are also
important for India's poverty reduction.

259. (d) Inclusive agriculture growth is key to reduce poverty
in the near future.

260. (d) Increased social sector spending is imperative for
large-scale job creation.

261. (a) From the given passage, it can easily be assumed that
state should have some institutions to ensure its
appropriate role in a digital society. Further, state should
also ensure that private parties do not violate the citizens'
right to privacy .

262. (b) The passage clearly indicates that engineering water
systems should be modernised and further augmented.

263. (a) In the given passage, the author stresses that the
distribution of your wealth across different kinds of assets
would be correct initiative as by doing so your risks would
minimised.


General Comprehension F165

264. (b) From the given passage, it can be inferred that
biotechnology regulation is an evolving process. Further,
biotechnology regulation should take into account socio-
economic aspects in decision-making.

265. (c) The most important point that can be reflected from
the passage is biotechnology's role cannot be confined to
the current priorities of developing GM crops.

266. (b) From the given passage, it can be inferred that the
economic reforms that started in 1991 have not helped in
improving the economy to expected levels.

267. (c) The most logical and rational inference that can be
made from the given passage is to get renewable resources
to market too soon may be costly .

268. (b) The assumption that India's commitment of reducing
emissions by 33% by 2030 shall be on the basis of gas-
based economy is correct and has been stated in the given
passage.

269. (c) From the given passage, it can be assumed that
genome editing does not require the transfer of genes from
one plant to another. It further says that through genome
editing, the chosen genes can be altered precisely in a
manner akin to the natural process that helps plants to
adapt to the environmental factors.

270. (c) The statement that solid waste management should
be integrated with the maintenance of drainage and
sewerage networks best reflects the critical message of the
passage.
271. (b) The most logical inference from the passage is
religious freedom under the Constitution is open to state
intervention.

272. (d) Relying on a homogeneous food source is not
desirable best reflects the critical message of the passage.

273. (d) The most rational and practical implication of the given
passage is that mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed
their children immediately after birth. Secondly , the
authorities should ensure the vaccination as prescribed.

274. (d) The most rational inference that can be made from the
passage is that the farmers' income will be higher with pulse
cultivation than with paddy cultivation. Secondly , in the
context of northern Indian agriculture, paddy straw has no
usefulness.

275. (b) The valid assumption with reference to the passage
can be the storage capacity of dams should not be fully
used before or during monsoon season.

276. (d) The inference drawn from the passage that it is
essential to rethink and redefine the economic role of the
State in the quest for development is not admissible.
Similarly, India has not made effective implementation of
its policies in social sectors nor made sufficient investment
in them also not well-founded.

277. (d) The inference that India's economy needs to be greatly
integrated with global economy so as to sustain its growth
momentum cannot be made from the given passage.
Similarly , the assumption 2 is also not tenable.

PASSAGE
He walked several miles that day but could not get anything to
eat or drink except some dry bread and some water, which he got
from cottagers and farmers. As night fell, he slept under a haystack
lying in a meadow. He felt frightened at first, for the wind blew
awfully over the empty fields. He felt cold and hungry , and was
feeling more lonely than he had ever felt before. He, however,

PASSAGE
In spring, polar bear mothers emerge from dens with three month
old cubs. The mother bear has fasted for as long as eight months
but that does not stop the young from demanding full access to
her remaining reserves. If there are triplets, the most persistent
stands to gain an extra meal and it may have the meal at the
expense of others. The smallest of the litter forfeits many meals to
stronger siblings. Females are protective of their cubs but tend to
ignore family rivalry over food. In 21 years of photographing

For fourteen and a half months I lived in my little cell or room in
the Dehradun jail, and I began to feel as if I was almost a part of it.
I was familiar with every bit of it, I knew every mark and dent on
the whitewashed walls and on the uneven floor and the ceiling
with its moth-eaten rafters. In the little yard outside I greeted little
tufts of grass and odd bits of stone as old friends. I was not alone
in my cell, for several colonies of wasp and hornets lived there,
and many lizards found a home behind the rafters, emerging in
the evenings in search of prey. [2012-II]

We started pitching the highest camp that has ever been made.
Everything took five times as long as it would have taken in a
place where there was enough air to breathe; but at last we got
the tent up, and when we crawled in, it was not too bad. There
was only a light wind, and inside it was not too cold for us to take

we met no one as we drove swiftly along the narrow winding road
that led to the hills. As we climbed higher, it became colder and
rain began to fall, making it difficult at times to see the road. I
asked John, my companion, to drive more slowly. After we had
travelled for about twenty kilometers, there was still no sign of

A stout old lady was walking with her basket down the middle of

small peril to herself. It was pointed out to her that the pavement
was the place for foot-passengers, but she replied “I’m going to
walk where I like. We’ve got liberty now.” It did not occur to the
dear lady that if liberty entitled the foot-passenger to walk down
the middle of the road it also entitled the taxi-driver to drive on the
pavement, and that the end of such liberty would be universal
chaos. Everything would be getting in everybody else’s way and
nobody would get anywhere. Individual liberty would have
become social anarchy. [2013-II]

Gram Pradhan just because he is a VIP.
(c) This would ensure that you are not partial to either
of them.

Pradhan who is after all a human being. His ego
will not be able to tolerate for you so called high-
handedness.

7. (b) (a) If the residents make a police complaint. It can
work against the interest of both parties. Bringing
a third party into the dispute means creating a
greater misunderstanding between the two of
you.

of an enquiry into the matter you are taking the
responsibility for your actions. This way the
residents develop faith in your honesty and
integrity .

be more concerned about the safety of their own
lives as well as their belongings. That is a very
natural human tendency .

complaints you will be making then even more
rebellious. The small waves will becomes a

intended for.

role of a peace maker. So you must play your cards in
such a way that you do hurt the interest of either party]
(a) As an administrative authority one has to resort
to the course of law. In this case the views of
both parties must be taken into consideration
before resorting to any action.(b) Counselling the lady to adjust would be the most
foolish thing to do. If she had been able to adjust
she would not have come to you in the first place.
No woman in her senses would like to break her
own home. Especially not a newly-wed bride.
(c) Her parents may not want to approach you at all.
They would not want to spoil their daughter's
married life. Considering the amount of money
that is spent in traditional Indian marriages. It is
only natural that parents expect their daughters
to adjust and do not want to approach any one
for help.
(d) If she had to lodge a complaint with the police
she need not have approached you. The idea is
to arbitrate between both parties.

9. (c) (a) It is only possible to change oneself not others.
Convincing the subordinate will not be easy
because his ego will not accept that he is wrong.
(b) Here again the same argument will hold true. When
he is not sure that he is wrong he may not
reconsider the results so faithfully .
(c) It would be most advisable to revise the report on
your own. It would involve effort but it would be
the most peaceful and positive means.
(d) This would be the most negative way of
approaching the matter. Dealing with the
subordinated aggressively will only make him
rebellions and quarrelsome. It would be better to
avoid such a situation.

10. (a) (a) This would be the most positive approach to the
whole situation. Moreover, one has to follow the
protocol. So just lodge a complaint since the
results are yet awaited.

who are the deciding authority will only worsen
matters.
(c) By withdrawing your name you are harming
yourself. It is a negative approach.
(d) This is the most negative approach of all.

cooperation would not yield much results. It is
not so easy to change other.

cooperation; we have a chance to rectify the
situation.
(c) A negative approach. There is no guarantee that
the next set of team members will be cooperative.

not change the attitude of the team members.

12. (b) (a) Asking the screening committee for a clarification
will make it a long drawn process.
(b) Strict action has to be taken so that such incidents
do not take place in the future.
(c) This decision is based on the assumption that
the athlete is telling the truth. It is not fair to all.

are really sick and your leave may not be granted.
Your boss will definitely find it fishy .

spoiling relations with your immediate boss. Only
a good understanding between your boss and
you can ensure peace at work.
(d) This would be the best option. By discussing
your problem directly with your boss you will
both be able to resolve the issue and reach a
compromise. This will ensure a better working
relationship. The ice will be broken.

14. (d) (a) It would be practically not feasible to make the
supply of water free of cost.
(b) A one time fee for taps can be easily afforded by
the non – BPL families but not by the BPL families.
(c) This is again not a very feasable solution for it
may lead to a lopsided usage of water.
(d) An extremely feasible option. This will atleast
ensure that the consumption of water is well
regulated and the non – BPL families will not feel
exploited.

15. (d) (a) By giving a bribe you are accepting the situation
for what it is. Y ou are also inviting similar trouble
in the future.
(b) If you behave as if you are ignorant of the feelers
they will not stop. On the contrary the work will
get postponed indefinitely .
(c) Going to the higher officer will not ensure that
the matter will be looked into the higher officer
may himself be corrupt and may also be involved
in the matter.
(d) By sending in a formal complaint you can ensure
that you will be given a hearing. The letter will
reach the concerned authorities and can even be
sent to the press.
16. (a) When it comes to declining a request it is better to
discuss the matter explaining your inability to favour
your secretary who is very close to you in private.

17. (c) One sho uld no t let go the w ro ng do er b ecause that
w ill set a w ro ng precedence. So if the spur o f the
moment is not rife to act, one must restrain and make a
mental note instead. Complaint can be lodged later but
an urgent meeting can't be ignored or spoilt just
because of some unscrupulous people. They can be
taken to task later.

18. (d) The next meeting can be put on hold for a few minutes,
but the person who has already , made lot of effort to
reach the district magistrates office in anticipation of
help should be heard first. This humane attitude
towards common people and their problems will
enhance the respect of the chair, the person and the
district administration.

19. (d) This will make it very clear to him that doing small
favours are not part of job. You are far more responsible
for the position. The advise will show that you care
for him and a direct approach to the allotting authority
may work for him. This gives a lasting impression that
you follow the rules.

20. (a) A place where there is a strong opposition for family
planning, it is not easy to implement any programme
quickly or hastily . But persuasion and explanation
can surely make a difference. So, by logically explaining
the pro s and co ns o f the pro gamme, peo ple can b e
persuaded better though it may take longer.

21. (c) Extending a helping hand to someone for personal
reasons while sitting in a responsible position is
unethical and does not do justice to the trust and
responsibility of the authority conferred on you by
the authority . Your position and responsibility is far
more greater than personal obligations.

7) Quote based, Philosophy , 
Ethics•	In	2014	& 	2015, 	UPSC 	had 	asked 	schoollevel 	quotes 	such 	as 	“with great power

giving dole, education without values…” 
•	But	by	2018 	exam, 	the 	difficulty 	level 	of 	quotation 	/ 	philosophical 	essays 	has

and	values.”, 	“Reality 	does 	not 	conform 	to 	the 	ideal, 	but 	confirms 	it.” 	So 	unless 	
philosophy 	/ 	psychology 	/ 	literature 	is 	your 	optional 	subject, 	it’ s 	better 	to 	skip 	these 	
and	attem pt 	the 	remaining 	essays 	in 	each 	section 	of 	the 	question 	paper . 	Because 	the 	
amount	of 	time 	and 	effort 	required 	to 	master 	such 	philosophical 	essays 	will 	give 	you 	
a	very	poor	cost:	benefit.
Essay Writing Strategy
•	In	the	real 	exam , 	it 	is 	advisable 	to 	spend 	at 	least 	30 	
minutes	preparing 	a 	Mind 	Map 	/ 	outline 	sketch 	of

Mains Answer writing by Mrunal Patel
In	this	section, 	we’ll 	look 	at 	certain 	basic 	aspects 	of 	Mains 	answer 	writing, 	followed 	by 	the 	topicwise 	General 	Studies 	(Mains) 	
papers	since	the	syllabus	change	of	
2013.
Basic Rules of Formal English
While	you 	need 	not 	have 	impeccable 	command 	over 	every 	minute 	rule 	of 	English 	grammar 	but 	when 	writing 	mains 	answers, 	certain 	
basic	rules	of	formal	english	writing	must	be	kept	in	mind	such	as:
Rule#1: give full form before abbreviation:
Mention	full 	form 	for 	the 	first 	time 	followed 	by 	the 	abbreviation 	in 	brackets, 	then 	in 	subsequent 	sentences 	you 	may 	write 	the 	short 	
form.
Wrong GST	is	levied 	at 	multiple 	rates 	ranging 	from 	0 	per 	cent 	to 	28 	per 	cent. 	Ultra 	luxuries, 	demerit 	and 	sin 	goods 	are 	
subjected 	to	28	per	cent	GST.
Right: Goods	and 	Services 	T ax 	(GST) 	is 	levied 	at 	multiple 	rates 	ranging 	from 	0 	per 	cent 	to 	28 	per 	cent. 	Ultra 	luxuries, 	demerit 	
and	sin	goods	are	subjected 	to	28	per	cent	GST.
Rule#2: don’t use informal whatsapp chat abbreviations
You’ve	to	use	the	formal	english	words	only.
Wrong Right
•	yrs
•	Avg.
•	Wundn’t•	years
•	Average
•	Wouldn’t’
Rule#3: Avoid random capitalization
“Whenever 	V irtue 	Subsides, 	And 	W ickedness 	Raises 	Its 	Head, 	I 	Manifest 	Myself 	T o 	Restore 	The 	Glory 	Of 	Religion.” 	says 	Krishna 	
in	Gita.
Here	only	‘whatever’, 	‘I’,	Krishna’	 and 	 ‘Gita’	 need 	 to 	 be 	 capital.
Rule#4: Avoid verbose and passive language
Poor Primary	reason	for	this	is	the	fact	that	humans	are	evil.
Better Primary	reason	is	humans	are	evil.
Rule#5: Subject verb agreement
Wrong Right
None	of	the	factors		are	relevant. None	of	the	factors	is	relevant.
Rule#6: Section and Article
•	If	you’re	writing 	about 	Constitution, 	then 	use 	the 	word 	‘Article’: 	Article 	21 	of 	the 	Constitution 	of 	India, 	1950 	provides 	
that,	“No	person	shall	be	deprived	of	his	life	or	personal	liberty	except	according 	to	procedure 	established 	by	law.”
•	If	you’re	writing 	about 	a 	law , 	then 	use 	the 	word 	‘Section’: 	Supreme 	Court 	has 	declared 	that 	consensual 	sex 	between 	adults 	
would	no 	longer 	be 	a 	crime 	under 	Section 	377 	of 	the 	Indian 	Penal 	Code 	(IPC). 	(Recall 	that 	full 	form 	must 	be 	mentioned 	
before	abbreviation)TOPICWISE MAIN GENERAL STUDIES PAPER-(2013-19)

GSM4: Topicwise Ethics Papers since Syllabus Change (2013-19)
•	In	2013,	UPSC	in	its	full	wisdom	(and	haste),	had	changed	mains	syllabus.	 Fourth	general	studies	paper	is	“ethics,	
integrity,	aptitude”.
•	Just	like	Demonetization,	 the	GS4	Syllabus	is	noble	in	its	objective	 but	hastily	thought	and	illplanned.	 Too	many	topics,	
verbose,	repeating.	 Hence	difficult	to	do	any	‘trend’	analysis	against	previous	years,	if	we	follow	the	syllabus	sequence	
given	by	UPSC.
•	Therefore,	 I’ve	combined	 and	bifurcated	 syllabus	topics;	and	I’m	combining	 ‘case	study’	marks	within	theory	topics.	The

Case-Study: Promoting Girl education while ensuring their safety (2015)
You	are	recently	posted	as	district	development	 officer	of	a	district.	Shortly	thereafter	 you	found	that	there	is	considerable	 tension	
in	the	rural	areas	of	your	district	on	the	issue	of	sending	girls	to	schools.
The	elders	of	the	village	feel	that	many	problems	 have	come	up	because	girls	are	being	educated	 and	they	are	stepping	out	of	the	safe	
environment	 of	the	household.	 They	are	of	the	view	that	the	girls	should	be	quickly	married	off	with	minimum	 education.	 The	girls	
are	also	competing	 for	jobs	after	education,	 which	have	traditionally	 remained	 in	boys’	exclusive	 domain,	adding	to	unemployment	
amongst	male	population.
The	younger	generation	 feels	that	in	the	present	era,	girls	should	have	equal	opportunities	 for	education	 and	employment,	 and	other	
means	of	livelihood.	 The	entire	locality	is	divided	between	the	elders	and	the	younger	lot	and	further	sub-divided	 between	sexes	
in	both	generations.	 You	come	to	know	that	in	Panchayat	 or	in	other	local	bodies	or	even	in	busy	crossroads,	 the	issue	is	being	
acrimoniously	debated.
One	day	you	are	informed	 that	an	unpleasant	 incident	has	taken	place.	Some	girls	were	molested,	 when	they	were	en	route	to	schools.	
The	incident	led	to	clashes	between	several	groups	and	a	law	and	order	problem	has	arisen.	The	elders	after	heated	discussion	 have	
taken	a	joint	decision	not	to	allow	girls	to	go	to	school	and	to	socially	boycott	all	such	families,	which	do	not	follow	their	dictate.

1.	 What	steps	would	you	take	to	ensure	girls’ 	safety	without	disrupting	their	education?

2.	 How	 would	you	manage	and	mould	matriarchic	 attitude	of	the	village	elders	to	ensure	harmony	 in	the	inter-generational	
relations?	(250	words)		(25	Marks)

Case Study: politicization of bureaucracy (2019) 20marks
In	a	modern	democratic	 polity,	there	is	a	concept	of	the	political	executive	 and	permanent	 executive	 elected	people’s	representatives	
forms	the	political	executive	 and	bureaucracy	 form	the	permanent	 executive.	 Ministers	 frame	policy	decisions	 and	bureaucrats	
execute	these.	In	the	initial	decades	after	independence,	 the	relationship	 between	 the	permanent	 executives	 and	the	political	
executives	were	characterized	by	mutual	understanding,	respect,	and	cooperation,	without	encroaching	upon	each	other’s	domain.
However,	 in	subsequent	 decades,	 the	situation	 has	changed.	 There	are	instances	 of	the	political	executive	 insisting	 upon	the	
permanent	 executives	 to	follow	its	agenda.	Respect	for	an	appreciation	 of	upright	bureaucrats	 has	declined.	 There	is	an	increasing	
tendency	 among	the	political	executive	 to	get	involved	 in	routine	administrative	 matters	such	as	transfers,	 posting	etc.	Under	this	
scenario,	 there	is	a	definitive	trend	 towards	‘politicization	of	 bureaucracy’.	 The	rising	materialism	and	 acquisitiveness	in	 social	life	
has	also	adversely	impacted	upon	the	ethical	values	of	both	the	permanent	executive	and	the	political	executive.

Case-Study: Engineer: Bogus flyover vs deadline (2013)

10.	You	are	working	as	an	Executive	 Engineer	 in	the	construction	 cell	of	a	Municipal	 Corporation	 and	are	presently	 in-charge	 of	
the	construction 	of	a	flyover.	There	are	two	Junior	Engineers	 under	you	who	have	the	responsibility	 of	day-to-day	 inspection	
of	the	site	and	are	reporting	 to	you,	while	you	are	finally	reporting	 to	the	Chief	Engineer	 who	heads	the	cell.	While	the	
construction	 is	heading	towards	completion,	 the	Junior	Engineers	 have	been	regularly	 reporting	 that	all	construction	 is	taking	
place	as	per	design	specifications.	 However,	 in	one	of	your	surprise	inspections,	 you	have	noticed	some	serious	deviations	 and	
lacunae	which,	in	your	opinion,	are	likely	to	affect	the	safety	of	the	flyover.	Rectification	 of	these	lacunae	at	this	stage	would	
require	a	substantial	 amount	of	demolition	 and	rework	which	will	cause	a	tangible	loss	to	the	contractor	 and	will	also	delay	
completion.	 There	is	a	lot	of	public	pressure	on	the	Corporation	 to	get	this	construction	 completed	 because	of	heavy	traffic	
congestion	 in	the	area.	When	you	brought	this	matter	to	the	notice	of	the	Chief	Engineer,	 he	advised	you	that	in	his	opinion	it	
is	not	a	very	serious	lapse	and	may	be	ignored.	He	advised	for	further	expediting	 the	project	for	completion	 in	time.	However,	
you	are	convinced	that	this	was	a	serious	matter	which	might	affect	public	safety	and	should	not	be	left	unaddressed.

Case-Study: Ethics not essential (2014)
Suppose one of your close friends, who is also aspiring for civil services, comes to you for discussing some of the issues 
related to ethical conduct in public service. He raises the following points :

1.	 In	the 	present 	times, 	when 	unethical 	environment 	is 	quite 	prevalent, 	individual 	attempts 	to 	stick 	to 	ethical 	principles 	may 	
cause	a	lot 	of 	problems 	in 	one’ s 	career . 	It 	may 	also 	cause 	hardship 	to 	the 	family 	members 	as 	well 	as 	risk 	to 	one’ s 	life. 	Why 	
should	we	not	be	pragmatic 	and	follow	the	path	of	least	resistance, 	and	be	happy	with	doing	whatever	good	we	can?

2.	 When 	so 	many 	people 	are 	adopting 	wrong 	means 	and 	are 	grossly 	harming 	the 	system, 	what 	difference 	would 	it 	make 	if 	only 	
a	small	minority	tries	to	be	ethical?	They 	 are 	 going 	 to 	 be 	 rather 	 ineffective 	 and 	 are 	 bound 	 to 	 get 	 frustrated.

3.	 If	we 	become 	fussy 	about 	ethical 	considerations, 	will 	it 	not 	hamper 	the 	economic 	progress 	of 	our 	country? 	After 	all, 	in 	the 	
present	age	of	high	competition, 	we	cannot	afford	to	be	left	behind	in	the	race	of	development.

4.	 It	is 	understandable 	that 	we 	should 	not 	get 	involved 	in 	grossly 	unethical 	practices, 	but 	giving 	and 	accepting 	small 	gratifications 	
and	doing 	small 	favours 	increases 	everybody’ s 	motivation. 	It 	also 	makes 	the 	system 	more 	efficient. 	What 	is 	wrong 	in 	adopting 	
such	practices?

Case-Study: Ineligible beneficiary for health scheme (2018)
Rakesh	is	a	responsible	 district	level	officer,	who	enjoys	the	trust	of	his	higher	officials.	 Knowing	 his	honesty,	the	government	
entrusted	 him	with	the	responsibility	 of	identifying	 the	beneficiaries	 under	a	health	care	scheme	meant	for	senior	citizens.	The	
criteria	to	be	a	beneficiary	are	the	following:

1.	 60	years	of	age	or	above.

2.	 Belonging	to	a	reserved	community.

3.	 Family	income	of	less	than	1	Lakh	rupees	per	annum.

4.	 Post-treatment	prognosis	is	likely	to	be	high	to	make	a	positive	difference	to	the	quality	of	life	of	the	beneficiary.
One	day,	an	old	couple	visited	Rakesh’s	 office	with	their	application.	 They	have	been	the	residents	 of	a	village	in	his	district	since	
their	birth.	The	old	man	is	diagnosed	 with	a	rare	condition	 that	causes	obstruction	 in	the	large	intestine.	 As	a	consequence,	 he	has

During	an	inspection	 of	the	doctor’s	clinic,	your	officers	have	found	out	some	major	irregularities.	 A	few	of	them	are	substantial	
which	had	resulted	in	considerable	 withholding	 of	tax	that	should	be	paid	by	him	now.	The	doctor	is	cooperative.	 He	undertakes	 to	
pay	the	tax	immediately.	 However,	 there	are	certain	other	deficiencies	 in	his	tax	compliance	 which	are	purely	technical	 in	nature.	
If	these	technical	 defaults	are	pursued	by	the	agency,	considerable	 time	and	energy	of	the	doctor	will	be	diverted	to	issues	which	
are	not	so	serious,	urgent	or	even	helpful	to	the	tax	collection	 process.	Further,	in	all	probability,	 it	will	hamper	the	prospects	 of	the	
hospital	coming	up.	 There	are	two	options	before	you:

1.	 Taking	a	broader	view,	ensure	substantial	tax	compliance	and	ignore	defaults	that	are	merely	technical	in	nature.

2.	 Pursue	the	matter	strictly	and	proceed	on	all	fronts,whether	substantial	or	merely	technical.

Case-Study : Child Labourers in Sivakasi (2013)
Sivakasi	in 	T amil 	Nadu 	is 	known 	for 	its 	manufacturing 	clusters 	on 	firecrackers 	and 	matches. 	The 	local 	economy 	of 	the 	area 	is 	lar gely 	
dependent 	on	firecrackers 	industry.	It	has	led	to	tangible	economic 	development 	and	improved 	standard	of	living	in	the	area.
So	far	as	child 	labour 	norms 	for 	hazardous 	industries 	like 	firecrackers 	industry 	are 	concerned, 	International 	Labour 	Or ganization 	
(ILO)	has	set	the	minimum 	age	as	18	years.	In	India,	however,	this	age	is	14	years.
The	units 	in 	industrial 	clusters 	of 	firecrackers 	can 	be 	classified 	into 	registered 	and 	non-registered 	entities. 	One 	typical 	unit 	is 	
household-based 	work. 	Though 	the 	law 	is 	clear 	on 	the 	use 	of 	child 	labour 	employment 	norms 	in 	registered/non-registered 	units, 	it 	
does	not	include 	household-based 	works. 	Household-based 	work 	means 	children 	working 	under 	the 	supervision 	of 	their 	parents/
relatives.	T o 	evade 	child 	labour 	norms, 	several 	units 	project 	themselves 	as 	household-based 	works 	but 	employ 	children 	from 	outside. 	
Needless	to	say	that	employing 	children	saves	the	costs	for	these	units	leading	to	higher	profits	to	the	owners.
On	your	visit 	to 	one 	of 	the 	units 	at 	Sivakasi, 	the 	owner 	takes 	you 	around 	the 	unit 	which 	has 	about 	10-15 	children 	below 	14 	years 	of 	
age.	The	owner 	tells 	you 	that 	in 	his 	household-based 	unit, 	the 	children 	are 	all 	his 	relatives. 	Y ou 	notice 	that 	several 	children 	smirk, 	
when	the	owner 	tells 	you 	this. 	On 	deeper 	enquiry , 	you 	figure 	out 	that 	neither 	the 	owner 	nor 	the 	children 	are 	able 	to 	satisfactorily 	
establish	their	relationship 	with	each	other.

Land	needed 	for 	mining, 	dams 	and 	other 	lar ge-scale 	projects 	is 	acquired 	mostly 	from 	Adivasis, 	hill 	dwellers 	and 	rural 	communities.

minimum 	land 	acquisition 	from 	private 	parties. 	Compensation 	rate 	for 	private 	parties 	was 	also 	finalized 	as 	per 	government 	rules. 	
Care	was	also 	taken 	to 	minimize 	deforestation. 	Once 	the 	project 	is 	announced, 	it 	is 	expected 	that 	there 	will 	be 	a 	huge 	spurt 	in 	real 	
estate	prices 	in 	and 	around 	that 	area. 	Meanwhile, 	the 	Minister 	concerned 	insists 	that 	you 	realign 	the 	road 	in 	such 	a 	way 	that 	it 	comes

the	prevailing 	rate 	which 	is 	very 	nominal, 	in 	and 	around 	the 	proposed 	mega 	road 	project. 	He 	also 	tries 	to 	convince 	you 	by 	saying 	
that	there 	is 	no 	harm 	in 	it 	as 	he 	is 	buying 	the 	land 	legally . 	He 	even 	promises 	to 	supplement 	your 	savings 	in 	case 	you 	do 	not 	have 	
sufficient	funds 	to 	buy 	the 	land. 	However , 	by 	the 	act 	of 	realignment, 	a 	lot 	of 	agricultural 	lands 	has 	to 	be 	acquired, 	thereby 	causing 	a 	
considerable 	financial 	burden 	on 	the 	government, 	and 	also 	the 	displacement 	of 	the 	farmers. 	As 	if 	this 	is 	not 	enough, 	it 	will 	involve 	
cutting	down 	of 	a 	lar ge 	number 	of 	trees 	denuding 	the 	area 	of 	its 	green 	cover . 	Faced 	with 	this	situation, 	what 	will 	you 	do? 	Critically

discovers 	that 	the 	information 	pertains 	to 	some 	of 	the 	decisio ns 	taken 	by 	him, 	which 	were 	found 	to 	be 	not 	altogether 	
right.	There 	were 	other 	employ ees 	also 	who 	party 	to 	these 	decisions 	were. 	Disclosure 	of 	the 	information 	is 	likely 	to 	lead 	
to	disciplinary 	action 	with 	possibility 	of 	punishment 	against 	him 	as 	well 	as 	some 	of 	his 	colleagues. 	Non-disclosure 	or

3.	 The	PIO 	could 	weigh 	the 	consequences 	of 	disclosing 	the 	information 	truthfully , 	including 	the 	effect 	on 	his 	career , 	
and	reply 	in 	a 	manner 	that 	would 	not 	place 	him 	or 	his 	career 	in 	jeopardy , 	but 	at 	the 	same 	time 	a 	little 	compromise 	
can	be	made	on	the	contents	of	the	information.

4.	 The	PIO	could	consult	his	other	colleagues 	who	are	party	to	the	decision	and	take	action	as	per	their	advice.
